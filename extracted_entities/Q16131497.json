{"wikidata_id": "Q16131497", "title": "James Murray (physician)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murray_(physician)", "summary": "Sir James Murray (1788\u20131871) was an Irish physician, whose research into digestion led to his discovery of the stomach aid Milk of Magnesia in 1809. He later studied in electrotherapy and led the research into the causes of cholera and other epidemics as a result of exposure to natural electricity. He was the first physician to recommend the breathing in of iodine in water vapour for respiratory diseases.\nBorn in Derry, Murray became a licentiate in midwifery having studied at the Edinburgh College of Surgeons in 1807. He undertook studies in pharmaceuticals, an area in which he became competent. In 1809 he developed the foundations of fluid magnesia, which contained a base ingredient of magnesium sulfate. He modified it for it to act as an aid for \"weak nerves\", low fever, spasms, cholera, and diarrhoea. He named his recipe Fluid Magnesia, and set up the company Sir James Murray & Son to successfully market it.\nMurray graduated from the University of Edinburgh as a Doctor of Medicine in 1829, and became the resident physician to Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, in 1831, a post Murray held until the 1840s. Murray was knighted in 1833 and received an honorary degree in medicine from Dublin University the following year. He was appointed as an inspector of anatomical schools in Ireland, and was a member of the central board of health, as well as the resident physician to the Netterville Dispensary and the Anglesey Lying-In Hospital, Dublin.\nMurray died at his home in Dublin on 8 December 1871. He is the great-grandfather of the English actor Michael Hordern."}
