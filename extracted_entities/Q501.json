{"wikidata_id": "Q501", "title": "Charles Baudelaire", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Baudelaire", "summary": "Charles Pierre Baudelaire (UK: , US: ; French: [\u0283a\u0281l(\u0259) bodl\u025b\u0281] (listen); 9 April 1821 \u2013 31 August 1867) was a French poet who also produced notable work as an essayist, art critic and translator. His poems exhibit mastery of rhyme and rhythm, contain an exoticism inherited from Romantics, and are based on observations of real life.His most famous work, a book of lyric poetry titled Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil), expresses the changing beauty of nature in the rapidly industrializing Paris during the mid-19th century. Baudelaire's original style of prose-poetry influenced a generation of poets including Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, among many others. He coined the term modernity (modernit\u00e9) to designate the fleeting experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility of artistic expression to capture that experience. Marshall Berman has credited Baudelaire as being the first Modernist."}
