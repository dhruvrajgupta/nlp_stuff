{"wikidata_id": "Q919156", "title": "Mike Bloomfield", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bloomfield", "summary": "Michael Bernard Bloomfield (July 28, 1943 \u2013 February 15, 1981) was an American guitarist and composer, born in Chicago, Illinois, who became one of the first popular music superstars of the 1960s to earn his reputation almost entirely on his instrumental prowess, as he rarely sang before 1969. Respected for his guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues musicians before achieving his own fame and was instrumental in popularizing blues music in the mid-1960s. In 1965, he played on Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited, including the single \"Like a Rolling Stone\", and performed with Dylan at that year's Newport Folk Festival.\nBloomfield was ranked No. 22 on Rolling Stone's list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2003 and No. 42 by the same magazine in 2011. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012 and, as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015."}
