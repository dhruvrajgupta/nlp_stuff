{"wikidata_id": "Q335688", "title": "Milorad Dodik", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milorad_Dodik", "summary": "Milorad Dodik (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0414\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043a, pronounced [m\u00eelora\u02d0d d\u01d2dik]; born 12 March 1959) is a Bosnian Serb politician serving as the 8th president of Republika Srpska since November 2022. Previously, he served as the 7th Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the collective federal head of state, from 2018 to 2022.\nDodik has also been serving as the president of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) since its creation in 1996, and has occupied a number of political positions in Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dodik was the prime minister of Republika Srpska from 1998 to 2001 and from 2006 to 2010, and the president of Republika Srpska from 2010 until 2018.\nMuch like the SNSD, Dodik was initially considered as a moderate and reformist alternative to the ultranationalist Serb Democratic Party in the 1990s and early 2000s. However, since then, Dodik and the SNSD have pursued an increasingly-nationalist and separatist line, invoking the right of the Bosnian Serbs to self-determination. His time in power has been characterised by authoritarianism, repudiation of federal Bosnian institutions, and closer connections to Serbia and Russia."}
