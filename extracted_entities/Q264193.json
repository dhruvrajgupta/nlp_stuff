{"wikidata_id": "Q264193", "title": "\u00c9mile Bernard", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Bernard", "summary": "\u00c9mile Henri Bernard (28 April 1868 \u2013 16 April 1941) was a French Post-Impressionist painter and writer, who had artistic friendships with Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and Eug\u00e8ne Boch, and at a later time, Paul C\u00e9zanne. Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with Cloisonnism and Synthetism, two late 19th-century art movements. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of modern art to which Bernard had contributed."}
