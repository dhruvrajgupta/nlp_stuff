{"wikidata_id": "Q1699438", "title": "John Bryan Taylor", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bryan_Taylor", "summary": "John Bryan Taylor (born 26 December 1928) is a British physicist known for his contributions to plasma physics and their application in the field of fusion energy. Notable among these is the development of the \"Taylor state\", describing a minimum-energy configuration that conserves magnetic helicity. Another development was his work on the ballooning transformation, which describes the motion of plasma in toroidal (donut) configurations, which are used in the fusion field. Taylor has also made contributions to the theory of the Earth's Dynamo, including the Taylor constraint."}
