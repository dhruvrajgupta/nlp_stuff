He remains the longest-serving Prime Minister of Spain to be freely elected.\nGonz\u00e1lez joined the PSOE in 1964, when it was banned under the Francoist regime. He obtained a law degree from the University of Seville in 1965. In 1974, the PSOE elected Gonz\u00e1lez as its Secretary-General after a split in its 26th Congress. After Franco's death and the beginning of the Spanish transition to democracy, Gonz\u00e1lez obtained a seat in the Congress of Deputies after he led the PSOE candidacy in the 1977 general election, but lost to Adolfo Su\u00e1rez.\nAfter the PSOE victory in the 1982 general election, Gonz\u00e1lez formed his first majority government, backed by 202 out of the 350 deputies at the Congress of Deputies, and led the Government of Spain for thirteen and a half years after three additional victories in the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections. In 1996, Gonz\u00e1lez lost the election to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar and the People's Party and was elected to the Congress of Deputies for the last time in the 2000 general election, from Seville."}
