He is known for M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory and M\u00f8ller scattering.\nHis suggestion in 1938 to Otto Frisch that the newly discovered process of nuclear fission might create surplus energy, led Frisch to conceive of the concept of the nuclear chain reaction, leading to the Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum, which kick-started the development of nuclear energy through the MAUD Committee and the Manhattan Project.M\u00f8ller was the director of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)'s Theoretical Study Group between 1954 and 1957 and later a member of the same organization's Scientific Policy Committee (1959-1972)."}
