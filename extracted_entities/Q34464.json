{"wikidata_id": "Q34464", "title": "Philip III of Spain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain", "summary": "Philip III (Spanish: Felipe III; 14 April 1578 \u2013 31 March 1621) was King of Spain. As Philip II, he was also King of Portugal, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia and Duke of Milan from 1598 until his death in 1621.\nA member of the House of Habsburg, Philip III was born in Madrid to King Philip II of Spain and his fourth wife and niece Anna, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain. Philip III later married his cousin Margaret of Austria, sister of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor.\nAlthough also known in Spain as Philip the Pious, Philip's political reputation abroad has been largely negative. Historians C. V. Wedgwood, R. Stradling and J. H. Elliott have described him, respectively, as an \"undistinguished and insignificant man,\" a \"miserable monarch,\" and a \"pallid, anonymous creature, whose only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice.\" In particular, Philip's reliance on his corrupt chief minister, the Duke of Lerma, drew much criticism at the time and afterwards. For many, the decline of Spain can be dated to the economic difficulties that set in during the early years of his reign. Nonetheless, as the ruler of the Spanish Empire at its height and as the king who achieved a temporary peace with the Dutch (1609\u20131621) and brought Spain into the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) through an (initially) extremely successful campaign, Philip's reign remains a critical period in Spanish history."}
