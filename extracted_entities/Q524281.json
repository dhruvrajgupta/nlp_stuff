{"wikidata_id": "Q524281", "title": "Robert Blake (actor)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Blake_(actor)", "summary": "Robert Blake (born Michael James Gubitosi; September 18, 1933 \u2013 March 9, 2023), billed early in his career as Mickey Gubitosi and Bobby Blake, was an American prolific Golden Globe and Emmy Award winning actor, who appeared in some 200 films. He was best known for starring in the 1967 film In Cold Blood and playing the title role in the late 1970s television series Baretta.Blake began his career in the 1930s performing as a child alongside his family in song and dance, but became famous as a child actor, with his lead role in the final years of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-era of the Our Gang (Little Rascals) short film series from 1939 to 1944. He also appeared as a child actor in 22 entries of the Red Ryder film franchise. In the Red Ryder series and in many of his adult roles, the Italian-American actor was often cast as an American Indian or Latino character. After a stint in the United States Army, Blake returned to acting in both television and movie roles. Blake continued acting until 1997's Lost Highway.  Owing to Blake becoming one of the first child actors to successfully transition to mature roles as an adult, author Michael Newton called his career \"one of the longest in Hollywood history.\"Blake's later career unravelled in what was called an O.J. Simpson style case, in March 2005, with Blake being criminally tried, but acquitted of the 2001 murder of his second wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. In November 2005, he was found liable in a California civil court for her wrongful death."}
