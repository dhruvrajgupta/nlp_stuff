{"wikidata_id": "Q963523", "title": "Monty Roberts", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Roberts", "summary": "Marvin Earl \"Monty\" Roberts MVO (born May 14, 1935) is an American horse trainer who promotes his techniques of natural horsemanship through his Join-Up International organization, named after the core concept of his training method. Roberts believes that horses use a non-verbal language, which he terms \"Equus,\" and that humans can use this language to communicate with horses.  In order to promulgate his methods, Roberts has authored a number of books including his original best-seller, The Man Who Listens to Horses, and regularly tours with a live demonstration.  He runs an Equestrian Academy in Solvang, California and an \"online university\" to promote his ideas."}
