{"wikidata_id": "Q16015647", "title": "Linda Taylor", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Taylor", "summary": "Linda Taylor (born Martha Louise White; c. January 1926 \u2013 April 18, 2002) was an American woman who committed extensive welfare fraud and, after the publication of an article in the Chicago Tribune in fall 1974, became identified as the \"welfare queen\". Accounts of Taylor's activities were used by then Presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, for his 1976 presidential campaign onwards, to illustrate his criticisms of social programs in the United States. Her criminal activities are believed to have extended beyond welfare fraud and may have included assault, theft, insurance fraud, bigamy, kidnapping, and possibly even murder."}
