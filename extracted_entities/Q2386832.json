In her case mysticism assumed a form more strictly religious, and she continued to mourn her brother's loss of his early Catholic faith. Five years older than he, she cherished a love for him which was blended with a somewhat motherly anxiety. After his death she began the collection and publication of the scattered fragments of his writings. She died, however, before her task was completed.\nSee Sainte-Beuve, Causeries du lundi (vol. xii.) and Nouveaux Lundis (vol. iii.); G Merlet, Causeries sur les femmes et les hIres (Paris, 1865); Selden, L'Esprit des femmes de notre temps (Paris, 1864); Marelle, Eug\u00e9nie et Maurice de Gu\u00e9rin (Berlin, 1869); Harriet Parr, M. and E. de Gu\u00e9rin, a monograph (London, 1870); and Matthew Arnold's essays on Maurice and Eug\u00e9nie de Gu\u00e9rin, in his Essays in Criticism."}
