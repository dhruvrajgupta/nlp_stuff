She was the youngest child of King John III of Sweden and Catherine Jagiellon. She was close to her brother Sigismund Vasa, King of Poland (1587\u20131632) and King of Sweden (1592\u201399).  Raised a Catholic, Anna converted to Lutheranism in 1584 which made her an ineligible bride for many of Europe's Catholic royals and she remained unmarried."}
