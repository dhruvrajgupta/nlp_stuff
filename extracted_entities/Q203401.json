{"wikidata_id": "Q203401", "title": "Edward Hopper", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper", "summary": "Edward Hopper (July 22, 1882 \u2013 May 15, 1967) was an American realist painter and printmaker. While he is widely known for his oil paintings, he was equally proficient as a watercolorist and printmaker in etching.\nHopper created subdued drama out of commonplace subjects 'layered with a poetic meaning', inviting narrative interpretations. He was praised for \"complete verity\" in the America he portrayed.  His career benefited significantly from his marriage to fellow-artist Josephine Nivison, who contributed much to his work, both as a life-model and as a creative partner."}
