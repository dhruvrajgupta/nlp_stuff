{"wikidata_id": "Q24206012", "title": "James Hewitt, 2nd Viscount Lifford", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hewitt,_2nd_Viscount_Lifford", "summary": "James Hewitt, 2nd Viscount Lifford (27 October 1750 \u2013 15 April 1830), was an Anglo-Irish peer and Church of Ireland clergyman.\nHewitt was the eldest son of James Hewitt, 1st Viscount Lifford, and his first wife Mary Rhys Williams. The Hewitt family came originally from Coventry: James' father was sent to Ireland in 1767 as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Despite much criticism of his appointment, he proved to be an outstanding success in the office, and for many years afterwards, he was fondly remembered by the Irish Bar as \"the great Lord Lifford\". Mary died in 1765, and her widower in the following year remarried Ambrosia Bayley, a noted beauty who became very popular in Ireland. The younger James was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and Christ Church, Oxford.\nOn 28 September 1789, he succeeded to his father's titles and assumed his seat in the Irish House of Lords. He was Dean of Armagh between 1796 and his death in 1830."}
