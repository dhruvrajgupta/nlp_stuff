She is the first woman and first openly gay person to hold the office.She entered government as the minister of public administration and local self-government from 11 August 2016 until 29 June 2017, under Prime Minister Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 and Acting Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107. In this role, Brnabi\u0107 initiated reforms of central government services in Serbia.\nAfter he was inaugurated as the president of Serbia on 31 May 2017, Vu\u010di\u0107 proposed Brnabi\u0107 as his successor in June 2017. Prime Minister Brnabi\u0107 and her cabinet were voted into office on 29 June 2017 by a majority of 157 out of 250 Members of the National Assembly of Serbia. Elected as a non-partisan politician, she joined the ruling Serbian Progressive Party in 2019, and was subsequently elected as vice president in 2021.\nIn 2019, Brnabi\u0107 was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 88th most powerful woman in the world and as the 19th most powerful female political and policy leader. Some observers believe that she has no political power in line with the constitutional role of chief of the executive, arguing instead that Vu\u010di\u0107 wields power in his capacity as the president."}
