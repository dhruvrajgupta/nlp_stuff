{"wikidata_id": "Q6205057", "title": "John Taylor of Caroline", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_of_Caroline", "summary": "John Taylor (December 19, 1753 \u2013 August 21, 1824), usually called John Taylor of Caroline, was a politician and writer. He served in the Virginia House of Delegates (1779\u201381, 1783\u201385, 1796\u20131800) and in the United States Senate (1792\u201394, 1803, 1822\u201324).  He wrote several books on politics and agriculture. He was a Jeffersonian Republican and his works provided inspiration to the later states' rights and libertarian movements.  Sheldon and Hill (2008) locate Taylor at the intersection of republicanism  and classical liberalism. They see his position as a \"combination of a concern with Lockean natural rights, freedom, and limited government along with a classical interest in strong citizen participation in rule to prevent concentrated power and wealth, political corruption, and financial manipulation.\""}
