She is one of the most prolific film directors of contemporary Spain, having directed twelve feature-length films since the beginning of her film career in 1988, in addition to documentary films, shorts, and commercials. Her films depart from the traditional national cinema of Spain, and help to \u201cuntangle films from their national context ... clearing the path for thinking about national film from different perspectives.\u201d The recurring themes of \u201cemotions, feelings, and existential conflict\u201d coupled with her distinct visual style secure the \u201cmultifaceted (she directs, writes, produces, shoots, and acts)\u201d filmmaker's status as a \u201cCatalan auteur.\u201d"}
