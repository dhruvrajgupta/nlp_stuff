In 1959 he and his friend A. E. Dyson founded the literary journal Critical Quarterly. English teachers in more than half the grammar schools in the country subscribed to it. The journal published five Black Papers between 1969 and 1977. These were controversial, due to their criticism of comprehensive schools and child-centred teaching methods.In February 1993 Cox gave a half-hour Opinions lecture televised on Channel 4 and subsequently published in The Times as \"The right is wrong on English teaching\"."}
