{"wikidata_id": "Q7184617", "title": "Philip of Amphipolis", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_of_Amphipolis", "summary": "Philip of Amphipolis  was a Greek writer of unknown date, remarkable for his obscenity, of which Suidas has given a sufficiently significant specimen. He wrote a history of Rhodes, which Suidas especially stigmatizes for the obscenity of its matter, a history of the Cos island and Thasiaca a history of Thasos. He wrote some other works not enumerated by Suidas. Theodorus Priscianus, an ancient medical writer, classes Philip of Amphipolis with Herodian and Iamblichus the Syrian, as a pleasant writer of amatory tales, whose works tended to allure the mind to the pursuit of pleasure. All his works appear to be lost."}
