Ciar\u00e1n was bishop of Saighir (Seir-Kieran) and remains the patron saint of its successor, the diocese of Ossory.\nHis feast day is celebrated on 5 March.  He is sometimes called Saint Ciar\u00e1n the Elder (Latin: Kyaranus or Ciaranus Maior) to distinguish him from the other 6th-century Irish Saint Ciar\u00e1n, who was abbot of Clonmacnoise.  He shares the feast date of 5 March with his mother, St. Liad\u00e1n, and his disciple and episcopal successor, St. Carthach the Elder.\nHis identity is sometimes equated with that of Saint Piran."}
