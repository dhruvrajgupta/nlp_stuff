{"wikidata_id": "Q210798", "title": "Joris-Karl Huysmans", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joris-Karl_Huysmans", "summary": "Charles-Marie-Georges Huysmans (US: , French: [\u0283a\u0281l ma\u0281i \u0292\u0254\u0281\u0292 \u0265ism\u0251\u0303s]; 5 February 1848 \u2013 12 May 1907) was a French novelist and art critic who published his works as Joris-Karl Huysmans (pronounced [\u0292\u0254\u0281is ka\u0281l -], variably abbreviated as J. K. or J.-K.). He is most famous for the novel \u00c0 rebours (1884, published in English as Against the Grain and as Against Nature). He supported himself by way of a 30-year career in the French civil service.\nHuysmans's work is considered remarkable for its idiosyncratic use of the French language, large vocabulary, descriptions, satirical wit and far-ranging erudition. First considered part of Naturalism, he became associated with the decadent movement with his publication of \u00c0 rebours. His work expressed his deep pessimism, which had led him to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. In later years, his novels reflected his study of Catholicism, religious conversion, and becoming an oblate. He discussed the iconography of Christian architecture at length in La cath\u00e9drale (1898), set at Chartres and with its cathedral as the focus of the book.\nL\u00e0-bas (1891), En route (1895) and La cath\u00e9drale (1898) are a trilogy that feature Durtal, a character on a spiritual journey who eventually converts to Catholicism. In the novel that follows, L'Oblat (1903), Durtal becomes an oblate in a monastery, as Huysmans himself was in the Benedictine Abbey at Ligug\u00e9, near Poitiers, in 1901. La cath\u00e9drale was his most commercially successful work. Its profits enabled Huysmans to retire from his civil service job and live on his royalties."}
