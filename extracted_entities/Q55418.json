She has been referred to as a \"leading force\" of the New German Cinema movement. Von Trotta's extensive body of work has won awards internationally. She was married to and collaborated with director Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff.  Although they made a successful team, von Trotta felt she was seen as secondary to Schl\u00f6ndorff. Subsequently, she established a solo career for herself and became \"Germany's foremost female film director, who has offered the most sustained and successful female variant of Autorenkino in postwar German film history\". Certain aspects of von Trotta's work have been compared to Ingmar Bergman's features from the 1960s and 1970s.Von Trotta has been called \"the world's leading feminist filmmaker\". The predominant aim of her films is to create new representations of women. Her films are concerned with relationships between and among women (sisters, best friends, etc.), as well as with relationships between women and men, and include political settings. Nevertheless, she rejects the suggestion that she makes \"women's films\".She is a recipient of one Golden Lion at Venice Film Festival, 2 David di Donatello Awards, Gold Hugo Award at Chicago International Film Festival, Lifetime Achievement Award at European Film Award, Lifetime Achievement Award at German Film Awards, 2 Palme d'Or nominations at Cannes Film Festival, and numerous other awards and nominations."}
