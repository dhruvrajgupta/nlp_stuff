Mowrer, who was 36-years old when he took office for his first term in 1974, became the youngest mayor in Bethlehem's history at the time. Mowrer's record as the city's youngest mayor held until Mayor Don Cunningham was sworn in 1998 at the age of 31.Nicknamed \"Main Street Mayor\", Mowrer is credited with the preservation of Bethlehem's historic downtown business district, which has now become a major tourist attraction for the city. During the 1970s, Mowrer eschewed the trend of demolishing older commercial buildings in favor of preserving Bethlehem's older structures. More recently, Mowrer, who returned to the Bethlehem city council in the 2000s, opposed the opening of a casino in Bethlehem following the legalization of slot machines by the government of Pennsylvania. Despite Mowrer's opposition, the casino was approved and the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem opened in 2009."}
