Originally from Sydney, Thompson played for several years in the New South Wales U17 (\"Under 17\") and U19 squads.  She then sought further opportunities in Tasmania, where she became a key player for Tasmania.Thompson was included in the Hobart Hurricanes squad for its inaugural WBBL|01 season (2015\u201316), and was again selected for the WBBL|02 season (2016\u201317).  She is not one of the big guns in the WBBL, and sometimes plays essentially as a specialist fielder, a role she accepts without rancour. In November 2018, she was named in the Hobart Hurricanes' squad for the 2018\u201319 Women's Big Bash League season.Off the field, Thompson works as a physiotherapist."}
