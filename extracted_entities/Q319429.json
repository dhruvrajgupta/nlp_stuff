In 1998, he formed the band Reamonn. Over the 11 years that Garvey was their frontman, they saw chart-topping success in Europe, with a number of gold and platinum selling albums, Tuesday, Dream No. 7, Beautiful Sky, Wish and Eleven and several sold out European tours. In 2011, after the release of the band's best-of album/DVD \"Eleven\", and a best-of tour, the band parted ways. Garvey took this time to pursue a solo career, which gave birth to his first solo album \"Can't Stand the Silence\". This album saw Garvey's transition from anthem rock with Reamonn, to alternative electro pop."}
