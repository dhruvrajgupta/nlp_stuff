{"wikidata_id": "Q691402", "title": "Philip IV of Spain", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain", "summary": "Philip IV (Spanish: Felipe, Portuguese: Filipe; 8 April 1605 \u2013 17 September 1665), also called the Planet King (Spanish: Rey Planeta), was King of Spain from 1621 to his death and (as Philip III) King of Portugal from 1621 to 1640. Philip is remembered for his patronage of the arts, including such artists as Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, and his rule over Spain during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nBy the time of his death, the Spanish Empire had reached approximately 12.2 million square kilometers (4.7 million square miles) in area but in other aspects was in decline, a process to which Philip contributed with his inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform."}
