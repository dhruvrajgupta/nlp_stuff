{"wikidata_id": "Q2856817", "title": "Eug\u00e9nie Brazier", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A9nie_Brazier", "summary": "Eug\u00e9nie Brazier (12 June 1895 \u2013 2 March 1977), known as \"la M\u00e8re Brazier\", was a French chef who, in 1933, became the first person awarded six Michelin stars, three each at two restaurants: La M\u00e8re Brazier in the rue Royale, one of the main streets of Lyon, and a second, also called La M\u00e8re Brazier, outside the city. This achievement was unmatched until Alain Ducasse was awarded six stars with the publication of the 1998 Michelin Guide.\nBorn in La Trancli\u00e8re in the French departement of Ain, near Lyon, Brazier was raised on a small farm, and entered domestic service in her teens. She learned to cook for her employers, and was taken on as a junior cook by the proprietor of a leading restaurant in Lyon. In 1921 she opened her own restaurant there, and having built the establishment into a nationally famous restaurant by the end of the decade, she opened a second in a converted chalet at the  Col de la Lu\u00e8re in the foothills of the Massif Central above the city.\nBrazier followed the traditions of Lyon's famous female cooks \u2013 the M\u00e8res lyonnaises \u2013 in avoiding over-elaborate dishes, preferring to offer fairly simple food of the highest quality. She influenced subsequent generations of French cooks, including Paul Bocuse and Bernard Pacaud, whom she trained at her restaurant. She is commemorated in scholarships and annual prizes for cookery writing awarded in her name. Her own recipes were collected and published in 1977 and an English translation was issued in 2014. She was offered but declined the  L\u00e9gion d'honneur, the highest French order of merit. Her original restaurant in Lyon, run by her family for many years after her death, was bought by the Michelin-starred chef Mathieu Viannay in 2007, who retains her classics on the menu."}
