Heller Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. Yoo became known for his legal opinions concerning executive power, warrantless wiretapping, and the Geneva Conventions while serving in the George W. Bush administration, during which he was the author of the controversial \"Torture Memos\" in the War on Terror.  \nAs the deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) of the Department of Justice, Yoo wrote the Torture Memos to determine the legal limits for the torture of detainees following the September 11 attacks. The legal guidance on interrogation authored by Yoo and his successors in the OLC were rescinded by President Barack Obama in 2009. Some individuals and groups called for the investigation and prosecution of Yoo under various anti-torture and anti-war crimes statutes.A report by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility stated that Yoo's justification of waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation methods\" constituted \"intentional professional misconduct\" and recommended that Yoo be referred to his state bar association for possible disciplinary proceedings. Senior Justice Department lawyer David Margolis overruled the report in 2010, saying that Yoo and Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee\u2014who authorized the memos\u2014had exercised \"poor judgment\" but that the department lacked a clear standard to conclude misconduct.\nIn 2020, Yoo advised Vice President Mike Pence that he had no constitutional authority to interfere with the certification of the 2020 presidential election."}
