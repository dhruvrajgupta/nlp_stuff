{"wikidata_id": "Q65565", "title": "Rudolf Roessler", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Roessler", "summary": "Rudolf Roessler (German: R\u00f6\u00dfler; 22 November 1897 \u2013 11 December 1958) was a Protestant German and dedicated anti-Nazi. During the interwar period, Roessler was a lively cultural journalist, with a focus on theatre. In 1933 while a refugee, he moved to Switzerland and established a small publishing firm in Lucerne known as Vita Nova that published works of exiled writers. Late in the summer of 1942, Roessler ran the Lucy spy ring, an anti-Nazi Soviet espionage operation that was part of the Rote Drei while working for Rachel D\u00fcbendorfer through the cut-out Christian Schneider. Roessler was able to provide a great quantity of high-quality intelligence, around 12,000 typed pages, sourced from the German High Command of planned operations on the Eastern Front, usually within a day of operational decisions being made. Later in the war, Roessler was able to provide the Soviet Union with intelligence on the V-1 and V-2 missiles. During the Cold War, Roessler reactivated his network and spied on NATO countries in Western Europe under orders from the military intelligence services of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, until he was arrested by the Swiss authorities and convicted of espionage in 1953."}
