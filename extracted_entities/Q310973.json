{"wikidata_id": "Q310973", "title": "Lorenzo Lotto", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Lotto", "summary": "Lorenzo Lotto (c. 1480 \u2013 1556/57) was an Italian painter, draughtsman, and illustrator, traditionally placed in the Venetian school, though much of his career was spent in other north Italian cities. He painted mainly altarpieces, religious subjects and portraits. He was active during the High Renaissance and the first half of the Mannerist period, but his work maintained a generally similar High Renaissance style throughout his career, although his nervous and eccentric posings and distortions represented a transitional stage to the Florentine and Roman Mannerists."}
