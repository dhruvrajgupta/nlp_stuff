A member of the New Democracy, he has been its president since 2016. He previously was Leader of the Opposition from 2016 to 2019, and Minister of Administrative Reform from 2013 to 2015.\nHe was first elected to the Hellenic Parliament for the Athens B constituency in 2004. After New Democracy suffered two election defeats in 2015, he was elected the party's leader in January 2016. Three years later, he led his party to a majority in the 2019 election.\nDuring his term as PM, Mitsotakis has received praise for his pro-European and technocratic governance, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, his handling of migration, and his handling of the Greek economy, with Greece being named the Top Economic Performer for 2022 by The Economist. This was in particular due to Greece in 2022 being able to repay ahead of schedule 2.7 billion euros ($2.87 billion) of loans owed to Eurozone countries under the first bailout it received during its decade-long debt crisis. However,  Mitsotakis has also received criticism, as during his term, Greece has experienced democratic backsliding and heightened corruption, a deterioration of freedom of the press, and his term was also marred by the Novartis corruption scandal the 2022 wiretapping scandal, as well as the tragic Feb. 2023 fatal train collision between a freight and passenger train accidentally routed on the same track."}
