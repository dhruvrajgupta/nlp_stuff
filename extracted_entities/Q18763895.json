He made his senior debut for Manicaland during the 2004\u201305 season of the one-day Faithwear Inter-Provincial Tournament. In four matches, Brown, a right-arm off-spinner, took only a single wicket (that of Tinashe Hove, against Matabeleland), conceding 119 runs from his 29 overs.Despite his performance at one-day level, later in the season Brown was selected in two of Manicaland's matches in the four-day Logan Cup. He was selected as an all-rounder in these matches, coming in as high as sixth in the batting order, and indeed bowling only 4.5 overs across the two games. On debut against Mashonaland, he scored 36 runs from 83 balls before being run out by Chamu Chibhabha, his highest first-class score. Brown's batting in the next match, also against Mashonaland, was less successful, and he finished with a first-class batting average of 19.66.\n\n\n== References =="}
