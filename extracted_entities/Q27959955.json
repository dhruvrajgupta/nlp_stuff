In April 2016, Welteroth was named editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue, making her the second person of African-American heritage in Cond\u00e9 Nast's 107-year history to hold such a title. Her promotion to editor at age 29 makes her the second youngest editor in Cond\u00e9 Nast history, behind former Teen Vogue EIC Lindsay Peoples Wagner who was 28 when she started in the role in Cond\u00e9 Nast. When she became beauty director of Teen Vogue in 2012, Welteroth was the first person of African-American heritage to serve in the role. She is credited for the notable increase of Teen Vogue coverage of politics and social justice, encouraging readers to become civically engaged, specifically during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Under Welteroth's leadership of Teen Vogue's shifting format, the magazine developed its first YouTube channel, featuring content on diverse subjects from campus style to cultural appropriation. The final print edition of Teen Vogue was December 2017.\nOn January 11, 2018, Welteroth resigned from Teen Vogue and moved to California and signed with CAA. In October 2018, Welteroth became a judge on Project Runway as part of the series' return to Bravo. In June 2019 her memoir, More Than Enough: Claiming Space for Who You Are (No Matter What They Say), was published by Viking."}
