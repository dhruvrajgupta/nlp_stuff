He is the fifth local boy we have signed in the past couple of years - Ravi Patel, Adam Rossington, Gurjit Sandhu and Ollie Wilkin are the others - and we hope that, along with these other cricketers, he will play a major role in Middlesex cricket in years to come.\u201d\nHe made his List A debut against Yorkshire in June 2013. In a rain-affected match, he didn't bat and had yet to bowl before the match came to an early end. Three days later, Helm played his second List A match against Unicorns where he took 3-27. He suffered a stress fracture which prevented him from reaching his full potential as a youth cricketer.\nIn the summer of 2020, Helm was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. He was included in England's 24-man group for behind closed doors training for the One Day International (ODI) series against Ireland, though he did not make the final squad. In November 2020, he was named as a reserve player in England's squad for their series against South Africa.In July 2021, Helm was named in England's ODI squad for their series against Pakistan, after the original squad for the tour was forced to withdraw following positive tests for COVID-19.
