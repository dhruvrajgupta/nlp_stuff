He was also a professor of journalism, distinguished by his conscious decision not to take up a doctorate despite having made all the preparations for it.\nHe was married to novelist Barbara Moore until her death in 2002 and regularly commuted between Memphis, Tennessee and Texas.  Retired from teaching, he is now married to Shirley Miller Lee, a former South African, living on a ranch in Central Texas.\nHis best-known book is The Ninth Man, in which a daring Nazi spy penetrates the White House and nearly succeeds in assassinating President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  He has also written six non-fiction books, including two popular university journalism texts (co-written with Edward Jay Friedlander)."}
