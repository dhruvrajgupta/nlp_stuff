His films are characterized by their emotional complexity, sensuality, and sumptuous visuals. He is also known for his frequent collaborations with actors Tilda Swinton, Dakota Johnson, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Michael Stuhlbarg, editor Walter Fasano and screenwriter David Kajganich.\nBorn in Palermo, Guadagnino spent part of his childhood in Ethiopia, but moved back to Italy with his family to escape the Ethiopian Civil War. He began his career directing short films and documentaries. He made his feature-film debut with The Protagonists (1999), the first of his many collaborations with Swinton. His follow-up Melissa P. (2005), based on the book of Melissa Panarello, was a commercial success in Italy but was met with mixed critical reception.\nGuadagnino gained further acclaim with his Desire trilogy which consists of the films: I Am Love (2009), A Bigger Splash (2015),  and Call Me by Your Name (2017). The latter, brought him international recognition, and marked the start of his creative partnership with Chalamet. Suspiria (2018) marked his first foray into the horror genre; a remake of the 1977 film, it polarized critics and was deemed a box office failure. The film was followed by We Are Who We Are (2020) a coming-of-age miniseries for HBO, and the romantic horror film Bones and All (2022).
