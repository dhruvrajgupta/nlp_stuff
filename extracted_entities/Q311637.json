{"wikidata_id": "Q311637", "title": "Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Philippe_II,_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans", "summary": "Louis Philippe II (Louis Philippe Joseph; 13 April 1747 \u2013 6 November 1793), was a major French noble who supported the French Revolution.\nLouis Philippe II was born at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud to Louis Philippe I, Duke of Chartres, and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. He was titled Duke of Montpensier at birth. When his grandfather Louis, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, died in 1752, his father became the new Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and Louis Philippe II became Duke of Chartres. When his father died in 1785, he became Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and First Prince of the Blood. He was styled as Serene Highness (French: Son Altesse S\u00e9r\u00e9nissime). \nIn 1792, during the Revolution, Louis Philippe changed his name to Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9. He was a cousin of King Louis XVI and one of the wealthiest men in France. He actively supported the Revolution of 1789, and was a strong advocate for the elimination of the present absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy. Louis Philippe voted for the death of Louis XVI; however, he was himself guillotined in 1793 during the Reign of Terror. His son, also named Louis Philippe, became King of the French after the July Revolution of 1830. After Louis Philippe II, the term Orl\u00e9anist came to be attached to the movement in France that favored a constitutional monarchy."}
