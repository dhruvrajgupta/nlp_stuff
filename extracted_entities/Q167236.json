{"wikidata_id": "Q167236", "title": "Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Henry,_Prince_of_Orange", "summary": "Frederick Henry (Dutch: Frederik Hendrik; 29 January 1584 \u2013 14 March 1647) was the sovereign prince of Orange and stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1625 until his death in 1647. In the last seven years of his life, he was also the stadtholder of Groningen (1640-1647). \nAs the leading soldier in the Dutch wars against Spain, his main achievement was the successful Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629. It was the main Spanish base and a well-fortified city protected by an experienced Spanish garrison and by formidable water defenses. His strategy was the successful neutralization of the threat of inundation of the area around 's-Hertogenbosch' and his capture of the Spanish storehouse at Wesel. The successful sieges under his command earnt him the epithet \u2018city forcer\u2019 (Dutch: stedendwinger)."}
