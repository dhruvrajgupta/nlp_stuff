As a member of the Free Officers Movement, he participated in the toppling of King Farouk that began the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and led to the establishment of the Republic of Egypt.\nMohieddine held important political and media roles throughout Gamal Abdel Nasser's presidency, although the two also had a number of fallings out. An outspoken individual, he was one of the few members of the revolutionary inner circle of Egypt able to disagree passionately with Nasser whilst still retaining Nasser's respect and admiration. His political influence diminished during the early part of Anwar Sadat's presidency until he cofounded a leftist political party, National Progressive Union Party (Tagammu), in 1976.\nUnder Mohieddine's leadership, Tagammu became a significant opposition force during Hosni Mubarak's rule."}
