His work was interdisciplinary, often blurring the lines between library science and technology. Peters was widely respected amongst his colleagues for his contributions, being called an \"imagineer,\" \"Mr. Internet himself,\" and even a \"prophet\". However, he is likely most well known as the founding executive director of CNI."}
