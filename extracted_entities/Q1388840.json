{"wikidata_id": "Q1388840", "title": "Joris Hoefnagel", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joris_Hoefnagel", "summary": "Joris Hoefnagel or Georg Hoefnagel (1542, in Antwerp \u2013 24 July 1601, in Vienna) was a Flemish painter, printmaker, miniaturist, draftsman and merchant.  He is noted for his illustrations of natural history subjects, topographical views, illuminations and mythological works.  He was one of the last manuscript illuminators and made a major contribution to the development of topographical drawing.\nHis manuscript illuminations and ornamental designs played an important role in the emergence of floral still-life painting as an independent genre in northern Europe at the end of the 16th century.  The almost scientific naturalism of his botanical and animal drawings served as a model for a later generation of Netherlandish artists. Through these nature studies he also contributed to the development of natural history and he was thus a founder of proto-scientific inquiry."}
