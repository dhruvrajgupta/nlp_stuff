A member of the National Rally (RN; previously the National Front, FN), she served as its president from 2011 to 2021. She has been the member of the National Assembly for the 11th constituency of Pas-de-Calais since 2017. Le Pen has been widely described as being far-right on the political spectrum.She is the youngest daughter of former party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and the aunt of former FN MP Marion Mar\u00e9chal. Le Pen joined the FN in 1986. She was elected as a regional councillor of Nord-Pas-de-Calais (1998\u20132004; 2010\u20132015), \u00cele-de-France (2004\u20132010) and Hauts-de-France (2015\u20132021), a Member of European Parliament (2004\u20132017), as well as a municipal councillor of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont (2008\u20132011). She won the leadership of the FN in 2011, with 67.6% of the vote, defeating Bruno Gollnisch and succeeding her father, who had been president of the party since he founded it in 1972. In 2012, she placed third in the presidential election with 17.9% of the vote, behind Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. She launched a second bid for the presidency at the 2017 election. She finished second in the first round of the election with 21.3% of the vote and faced Emmanuel Macron of centrist party En Marche! in the second round of voting. On 7 May 2017, she conceded after receiving approximately 33.9% of the vote in the second round. In 2020, she announced her third candidacy for the presidency in the 2022 election. She came second in the first round of the election, thus qualifying her for the second round against Macron, although she went on to lose in the second round to Macron.\nLe Pen has led a movement of \"de-demonisation of the National Front\" to soften its image, including limited expulsion of members accused of racism, antisemitism or P\u00e9tainism. She expelled her father from the party in August 2015, after he made fresh controversial statements. While relaxing some political positions of the party by revoking its opposition to same-sex partnerships, its opposition to unconditional abortions, and its support for the death penalty, Le Pen still advocates many of the same historical policies of her party, with particular focus on strong anti-immigration, nationalist and protectionist measures. She is supportive of economic nationalism, favoring an interventionist role of government, and is opposed to globalization and multiculturalism. Le Pen supports limiting immigration, banning ritual slaughter, and restricting the legality of circumcision. Le Pen has made supportive comments of Vladimir Putin and Russia in the past, advocating closer cooperation before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine; she strongly condemned the war in Ukraine, but stated Russia \"could become an ally of France again\" if it ends.Le Pen was featured by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2015. In 2016, she was ranked by Politico as the second-most influential MEP in the European Parliament, after President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz."}
