{"wikidata_id": "Q170586", "title": "Philip VI of France", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_VI_of_France", "summary": "Philip VI (French: Philippe; 1293 \u2013 22 August 1350), called the Fortunate (French: le Fortun\u00e9) or the Catholic (French: le Catholique) and of Valois, was the first king of France from the House of Valois, reigning from 1328 until his death in 1350.\nPhilip's reign was dominated by the consequences of a succession dispute. When King Charles IV of France died in 1328, the nearest male relative was his nephew King Edward III of England, but the French nobility preferred Charles's paternal cousin Philip. At first, Edward seemed to accept Philip's succession, but he pressed his claim to the throne of France after a series of disagreements with Philip. The result was the beginning of the Hundred Years' War in 1337.\nAfter initial successes at sea, Philip's navy was annihilated at the Battle of Sluys in 1340, ensuring that the war would occur on the continent. The English took another decisive advantage at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy (1346), while the Black Death struck France, further destabilising the country.\nIn 1349, King Philip VI bought the Province of Dauphin\u00e9 from its ruined ruler the Dauphin Humbert II and entrusted the government of this province to his grandson Prince Charles. Philip VI died in 1350 and was succeeded by his son King John II, the Good."}
