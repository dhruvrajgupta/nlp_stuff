Referred to as the \"Songbird Supreme\" by Guinness World Records, she is noted for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style, and signature use of the whistle register. An influential figure in popular music, Carey is credited for merging hip hop with pop music through her collaborations and popularizing the use of remixes. For the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly the 1994 song \"All I Want for Christmas Is You,\" she has been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\".\nCarey rose to fame in 1990 with her eponymous debut album under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, who married her in 1993. She became the first artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100, from \"Vision of Love\" to \"Emotions\". Carey gained worldwide success with the albums Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995) \u2015 both of which rank among the best-selling albums of all-time and spawned several hit singles, including \"Hero\", \"Without You\", \"Fantasy\", \"Always Be My Baby\" and \"One Sweet Day\", which topped the US Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart (1990s). After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new urban image and began incorporating hip-hop and R&B elements with the release of Butterfly (1997). She left Columbia in 2001 after eleven consecutive years of US number-one singles and signed a record deal with Virgin Records.\nFollowing Carey's highly publicized breakdown and the failure of the film Glitter (2001) and its soundtrack, Virgin bought out her contract and she signed with Island Records the following year. After a comparatively unsuccessful period, Carey returned to the top of the charts with one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single, \"We Belong Together\", topped the US Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s). Her subsequent ventures included roles in the films  Precious (2009), The Butler (2013), A Christmas Melody (2015), and The Lego Batman Movie (2017), being an American Idol judge, starring in the docu-series Mariah's World, performing at multiple concert residencies, and publishing the memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey (2020).\nCarey is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. An inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress, she was ranked as the fifth greatest singer of all-time by Rolling Stone in 2023, and second on VH1's list of the 100 greatest women in music. In 2019, Billboard named her the top-charting female solo artist, based on both album and song chart success. She holds the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles by a solo artist (19), a female songwriter (18), and a female producer (15). Carey is the highest-certified female artist in the United States and 10th overall, with 74 million certified album units. Among her accolades are 5 Grammy Awards, 10 American Music Awards, 15 Billboard Music Awards, and 8 Guinness World Records."}
