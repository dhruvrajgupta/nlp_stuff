His mother's name is not known.He died a few months after his father's death in the course of a palace intrigue. Vahram of Edessa, the historian tells us that he was cast into prison and poisoned to death.\nAfter the death of Thoros, his only son and heir was cast into prison by some wicked people, who administered to him a poisonous drug, thus the principality came to Leon, the brother of Thoros (\u2026).\nOther historians (e.g., Jacob G. Ghazarian, Vahan M. Kurkjian) suggest that Thoros I died without a male heir and was succeeded by Leon I."}
