Ex officio, he is the Primate of All England and the symbolic head primus inter pares of the worldwide Anglican Communion.\nWelby was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge where he read history and law. Later in life, he studied for ordination at St John's College, Durham. After several parochial appointments, he became Dean of Liverpool in 2007 and Bishop of Durham in 2011.\nWelby's theology is reported as representing the \"open evangelical\" tradition within Anglicanism. Having worked in business before his ordination, some of his publications explore the relationship between finance and religion and, as a member of the House of Lords, he sat on the panel of the 2012 Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards."}
