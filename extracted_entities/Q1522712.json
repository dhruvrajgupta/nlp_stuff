{"wikidata_id": "Q1522712", "title": "Stephen Graham (academic)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Graham_(academic)", "summary": "Stephen Graham FBA. is a British scholar of cities and urban life.  Since 2010, he has been Professor of Cities and Society at Newcastle University's School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape. A qualified urban planner, he has an interdisciplinary background in human geography, urbanism and the sociology of technology. A widely cited  author in contemporary urban studies and related fields, Graham\u2019s work explores how cities and urban life are being reshaped by increased movement and mobility, intensifying social inequalities, the widespread application of digital technology, and the widening insecurities that characterise urban life. His most recent work has sought to rethink cities and urban life in fully three-dimensional ways that help to understand  their increased vertical reach (both far above and far below ground level)."}
