{"wikidata_id": "Q5681", "title": "Andrea Mantegna", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna", "summary": "Andrea Mantegna (UK: , US: , Italian: [an\u02c8dr\u025b\u02d0a man\u02c8te\u0272\u0272a]; c.\u20091431 \u2013 September 13, 1506) was an Italian painter, a student of Roman archeology, and son-in-law of Jacopo Bellini. \nLike other artists of the time, Mantegna experimented with perspective, e.g. by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. His flinty, metallic landscapes and somewhat stony figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to painting. He also led a workshop that was the leading producer of prints in Venice before 1500."}
