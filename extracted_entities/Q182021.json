{"wikidata_id": "Q182021", "title": "Marie de' Medici", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_de%27_Medici", "summary": "Marie de' Medici (French: Marie de M\u00e9dicis, Italian: Maria de' Medici; 26 April 1575 \u2013 3 July 1642) was Queen of France and Navarre as the second wife of King Henry IV. Marie served as regent of France between 1610 and 1617 during the minority of her son Louis XIII. Her mandate as regent legally expired in 1614, when her son reached the age of majority, but she refused to resign and continued as regent until she was removed by a coup in 1617.\nA member of the powerful House of Medici in the branch of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, the wealth of her family caused Marie to be chosen by Henry IV to become his second wife after his divorce from his previous wife, Margaret of Valois. The assassination of her husband in 1610, which occurred the day after her coronation, caused her to act as regent for her son, Louis XIII, until 1614, when he officially attained his legal majority, but as the head of the Conseil du Roi, she retained the power.Noted for her ceaseless political intrigues at the French court, her extensive artistic patronage and her favorites (the most famous are Concino Concini and his wife, Leonora Dori Galiga\u00ef), she ended up being banished from the country by her son and dying in the city of Cologne, in the Holy Roman Empire."}
