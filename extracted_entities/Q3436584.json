He, along with his vice president Fred Silverman, initiated the network's \"rural purge\" in the early 1970s, which influenced much of American television at the time.  The purge canceled long-running and popular rural-oriented shows like Green Acres and The Beverly Hillbillies in order to introduce more urban-oriented shows targeted at the youth market, such as All in the Family, which reshaped American television by depicting issues previously considered unsuitable for a U.S. network television comedy.He died in  Santa Monica, California.\n\n\n== References =="}
