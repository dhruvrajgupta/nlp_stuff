After captaining West Germany to victory in the 1990 FIFA World Cup where he lifted the World Cup trophy, he was awarded the Ballon d'Or. In 1991, he was named the first FIFA World Player of the Year, and remains the only German to have received the award. He was also included in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020.\nMatth\u00e4us held the record (along Mexican goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal) of having played in five FIFA World Cups (1982, 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1998); more than any other outfield player in men's football, until the 2018 World Cup, in which Mexico's Rafael M\u00e1rquez equalled his record and 2022 FIFA World Cup in which Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi also equalled his record. He also won UEFA Euro 1980, and played in the 1984, 1988 and 2000 UEFA European Championships. In 1999, aged 38, Matth\u00e4us was again voted German Footballer of the Year, having previously won the award in 1990.\nMatth\u00e4us is the most capped German player of all time, retiring with a total of 150 appearances (83 for West Germany) in 20 years, and 23 goals. Matth\u00e4us is a member of the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living football players chosen by Pel\u00e9. Diego Maradona said of Matth\u00e4us, \"he is the best rival I've ever had. I guess that's enough to define him\", in his book Yo soy el Diego (I am the Diego).A versatile and complete player, Matth\u00e4us is regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, and was renowned for his perceptive passing, positional sense, well-timed tackling, as well as powerful shooting. During his career, he usually played as a box-to-box midfielder, although late in his career he played as a sweeper."}
