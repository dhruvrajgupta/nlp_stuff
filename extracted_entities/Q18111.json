{"wikidata_id": "Q18111", "title": "Li Keqiang", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Keqiang", "summary": "Li Keqiang (Chinese: \u674e\u514b\u5f3a; born 1 July 1955) is a Chinese economist and retired politician who served as the premier of the People's Republic of China from 2013 to 2023. He was also the second-ranked member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 2012 to 2022. Li was a major part of the \"fifth generation of Chinese leadership\" along with Xi Jinping, the CCP general secretary.\nBorn in Hefei, Anhui province in 1955, Li initially rose through the ranks of Chinese politics through his involvement in the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC), serving as its first secretary from 1993 to 1998. From 1998 to 2004, Li served as the governor of Henan and the province's party secretary. From 2004 to 2007 he served as the Party Secretary of Liaoning, the top political office in the province. From 2008 to 2013, Li served as the first-ranked vice premier under then-premier Wen Jiabao, overseeing a broad portfolio which included economic development, price controls, finance, climate change, and macroeconomic management.\nInitially seen as a candidate for becoming the paramount leader, Li instead assumed the post of premier in 2013, and has facilitated the Chinese government's shifting of priorities from export-led growth to a greater focus on internal consumption. During his term Li headed the State Council and was one of the leading figures behind China's Financial and Economic Affairs, Foreign Affairs, National Security and Deepening Reforms. Additionally, Li and his cabinet initiated the Made in China 2025 strategic plan in May 2015. He was succeeded as premier by Li Qiang in March 2023. \nGiven his Youth League experience, Li has generally been considered a political ally of former leader Hu Jintao and a member of the Tuanpai faction. Economically seen as advocating reform and liberalization, Li has been described as representing the more pragmatic and technocratic side of China's leadership. Some believe that Li has been sidelined by Xi Jinping's consolidation of power."}
