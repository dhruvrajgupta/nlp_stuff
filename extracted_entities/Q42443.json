Ironic and skeptical, he was considered in his day the ideal French man of letters. He was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, and won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament\".France is also widely believed to be the model for narrator Marcel's literary idol Bergotte in Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time."}
