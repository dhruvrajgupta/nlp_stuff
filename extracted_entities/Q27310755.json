Upon making his debut, Havertz became the club's youngest-ever debutant in the Bundesliga, and he became their youngest-ever goalscorer when he scored his first goal the following year. He is also the youngest player to reach the milestones of 50 and 100 league appearances in the German top flight.\nHavertz's performances sparked the interest of several European clubs, with Chelsea signing him in 2020 for a transfer worth \u20ac84 million (\u00a372 million), making him Chelsea's second-most expensive signing until Romelu Lukaku's signing in 2021. With Chelsea, Havertz won the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League, 2021 UEFA Super Cup, and the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, scoring the winning goals in the Champions League final and FIFA Club World Cup, while assisting teammate Hakim Ziyech's goal in the UEFA Super Cup.\nAfter appearing for Germany at various youth levels, Havertz made his senior international debut in September 2018, becoming the first player born in 1999 to represent the national team. He represented Germany at UEFA Euro 2020 and the 2022 FIFA World Cup."}
