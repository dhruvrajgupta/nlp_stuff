Before moving into the film industry, Crowe was a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine, for which he still frequently writes.Crowe's debut screenwriting effort, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), grew out of a book he wrote while posing for one year undercover as a student at Clairemont High School in San Diego. Later he wrote and directed another high school film, Say Anything... (1989), followed by Singles (1992), a story of twentysomethings which was woven together with a soundtrack centering on Seattle's burgeoning grunge music scene. He landed his biggest hit with Jerry Maguire (1996). \nThen Crowe was given a green-light to go ahead with a pet project, the autobiographical film Almost Famous (2000). The story centers on a teenage music journalist who is on tour with an up-and-coming band; it gives insight into his life as a 15-year-old writer for Rolling Stone. For his screenplay, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In late 1999, Crowe's second book was published, a question and answer session with filmmaker Billy Wilder entitled Conversations with Wilder.\nAfter the success of Almost Famous, further films followed including the psychological thriller Vanilla Sky (2001), the romantic comedy Elizabethtown (2005), the family-friendly film We Bought a Zoo (2011), and the romantic comedy Aloha (2015).  He also directed three musical documentaries, Pearl Jam Twenty (2011), The Union (2011), and David Crosby: Remember My Name (2019), and created the television series Roadies, which ran for one season in 2016 on Showtime."}
