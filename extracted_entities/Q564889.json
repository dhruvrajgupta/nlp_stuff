In 1964, Anne-Marie married Constantine and became queen consort of Greece. They had five children: Princess Alexia, Crown Prince Pavlos, Prince Nikolaos, Princess Theodora, and Prince Philippos. As queen, Anne-Marie spent much of her time working for a charitable foundation known as \"Her Majesty's Fund\" and later as the \"Anne-Marie Foundation\", which provided assistance to people in rural areas of Greece. In 1967, however, the royal family were forced into exile, and Constantine was later deposed as Greece transitioned into a republic.\nAnne-Marie is the youngest sister of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. She is also a first cousin of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and a second cousin of King Harald V of Norway. Anne-Marie and her husband Constantine were third cousins: they shared King Christian IX of Denmark as patrilineal great-great-grandfather. They also shared Queen Victoria as a great-great-grandmother."}
