He came from a prominent rabbinic family, the son of Shabbetai ben Isaiah Balbo, who wrote works of philosophy, Kabbalah, and Biblical commentary.A manuscript preserved in the Vatican Library contains several works of his, namely: a poem composed in 1453 on the occasion of the Fall of Constantinople and the cessation of the war; a poem lamenting his father's death (1456); a homiletic commentary on Psalm 28; and three sermons preached by Balbo in Khania in 1471, 1475, and 1477 respectively. Another manuscript contains an account of a disputation (vikua\u1e25) between Balbo and Moses Ashkenazi on gilgul.A work entitled Sha'are ra\u1e25amim, which is a supercommentary on Maimonides' commentary on the eleventh chapter of Sanhedrin, and a commentary on Ibn Ezra's hymn beginning E\u1e25ad levado be-en samuk, both bear the name of Michael Cohen as author, who is supposed by Moritz Steinschneider to be identical with Balbo."}
