As an orthopaedic surgeon at the Princess Elizabeth orthopaedic hospital, Exeter, he co-operated with an engineer, Dr. Clive Lee from the University of Exeter, to develop a new hip replacement. Their work led to improved quality of life for millions of people.Ling came from a medical family in Yorkshire, England. He studied medicine in Oxford and London. Becoming a consultant in orthopaedic surgery in Exeter, he performed the first 'Exeter-stem' hip replacement in 1970. His research and observations on the initial operations have resulted in the Exeter hip stem changing from a shiny stem, to matte stem and then back to shiny, with a further change to modular design and being the most popular hip implant in the United Kingdom."}
