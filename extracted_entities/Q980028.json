{"wikidata_id": "Q980028", "title": "Haakon Lie", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_Lie", "summary": "Haakon Steen Lie (22 September 1905 \u2013 25 May 2009) was a Norwegian politician who served as party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party from 1945 to 1969. Coming from humble origins, he became involved in the labour movement at an early age, and quickly rose in the party system. After actively working for the resistance movement and the exiled government during World War II, he was elected to the second-highest position in the party after the war, and his years in office were the most successful in the party's history.\nLie is widely considered \u2013 along with Einar Gerhardsen \u2013 to be the architect of the post-war success of the Labour Party, and of the Norwegian welfare state. At the same time, he has also been the subject of criticism for organising surveillance of Norwegian opposition figures, in particular communists. Lie remained active in Norwegian public life, even after his 100th birthday, and in 2008 he celebrated his 103rd birthday with the release of a new biography, \"Slik jeg ser det n\u00e5\" (As I see it now)."}
