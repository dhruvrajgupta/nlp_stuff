N\u00fa\u00f1ez del Prado based many of her sculptures off of the female form as well as taking inspiration from animals and landscapes native to Bolivia. Her work is highly sensuous, with rolling curves. She carved from native Bolivian woods, as well as black granite, alabaster, basalt and white onyx. Perhaps one of her most famous works is \"White Venus\" (1960), a stylized female body in white onyx. Another celebrated work is \"Mother and Child,\" sculpted in white onyx. Indigenous Bolivian cultures inspired much of her work."}
