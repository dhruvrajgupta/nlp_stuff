{"wikidata_id": "Q7342149", "title": "Robert Blake (Medal of Honor)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Blake_(Medal_of_Honor)", "summary": "Robert Blake was a Union Navy sailor during the American Civil War and a recipient of America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. Blake was the second African American to perform a Medal of Honor action; William Harvey Carney was the first. Blake was the first African American to actually receive a Medal of Honor - his was presented to him in 1864, while Carney did not receive his until 1900. But, because Carney's Medal of Honor action occurred first, Carney, not Blake, is usually credited with being the first African American Medal of Honor recipient."}
