{"wikidata_id": "Q6162964", "title": "Jason Lewis (Minnesota politician)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Lewis_(Minnesota_politician)", "summary": "Jason Mark Lewis (born September 23, 1955) is an American politician and former conservative radio personality who served as the U.S. representative for Minnesota's 2nd congressional district from 2017 until 2019. The district included most of the southern suburbs of the Twin Cities. A member of the Republican Party, he was a radio talk show host and a conservative political commentator before serving in Congress. He hosted the nationally syndicated Jason Lewis Show, based out of KSTP (AM) in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul radio market, from 2009 to 2014. \nLewis was elected to Congress in 2016 defeating Democrat Angie Craig. He succeeded retiring Republican incumbent John Kline. He lost his bid for a second term in 2018 in a rematch against Craig. He was the Republican nominee in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota. He was defeated by incumbent Democrat Tina Smith by a margin of 5.2 points, making it the closest Senate election in Minnesota since 2008. Some election observers attribute this close election to two pro-marijuana legalization parties taking a combined 7.69% of the vote."}
