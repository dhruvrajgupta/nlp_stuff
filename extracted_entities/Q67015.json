She owned and ran a food kiosk in West Berlin. Heuwer is frequently credited with the invention of the take-out dish that would become the currywurst, supposedly on 4 September 1949. The original Currywurst was a boiled sausage, fried, with a sauce of tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, curry powder and other ingredients.\nHeuwer was born in K\u00f6nigsberg. In January 1951, she registered a trademark for her sauce, Chillup.Heuwer moved her business to a larger facility at Kaiser-Friedrich-Stra\u00dfe 59, which, during its heyday, was open day and night and employed 19 saleswomen. On 29 June 2003, the day before what would have been her 90th birthday, a commemorative plaque was unveiled by Charlottenburg Mayor Monika Thiemen at the site where Herta Heuwer invented the currywurst.  Heuwer died in Berlin, aged 86. The Berlin Currywurst is now a protected commodity, officially and properly recognized by the German Patent and Trademark Office.In her honor, the Berlin State Mint even minted a commemorative medal in 2019 to mark the 70th anniversary of the invention of the Currywurst, on which she is depicted together with two Currywursts.On 30 June 2013, the centenary of Heuwer's birthday, was celebrated with a Google Doodle."}
