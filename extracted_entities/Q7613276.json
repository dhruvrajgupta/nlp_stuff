He played college football at the University of Missouri.\nHe was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 1996.  After playing 30 games he was released by the Colts in 1998 and finished out the season in Philadelphia.  After the 1999 season he went to Kansas City and the New York Jets.  He played for the New England Patriots in 2002 but his constant media interviews angered coach Bill Belichick while his advertised strengths at stopping the run went unrealized.  Following a 24-7 loss to a Tennessee Titans squad that rushed for 238 yards, Martin was interviewed by New York papers before a game against his former Jets team and his comments about the reduction in his role incensed Belichick, who cut him days before the game.<reference><reference/>\nMartin played for Houston in 2003 and Minnesota in 2004 before his career ended.  He finished with 127 games, 200 tackles, eight sacks, and two forced fumbles."}
