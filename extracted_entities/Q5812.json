At age 24, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors and five Masters titles in 2011. In 2015, Djokovic reached 15 consecutive finals and won a season-record 10 Big Titles. His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, where he completed a non-calendar year Grand Slam and his first career Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major titles simultaneously and setting a ranking points record (16,950). Following an injury-caused decline in form in 2017, Djokovic returned to dominance at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, sweeping three straight majors and returning to world No. 1. In 2021, Djokovic won the first three majors of the year and attempted to complete a Grand Slam at the US Open, but lost in the final to Daniil Medvedev. As of the 2023 Australian Open, Djokovic has won 10 of the last 18 majors.\nRepresenting Serbia, Djokovic led the Serbian national team to their first Davis Cup title in 2010 and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. Moreover, he won the bronze medal for Serbia at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Djokovic has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award four times (2012, 2015, 2016, 2019), the BBC Sports Personality World Sport Star of the Year award in 2011 and the L'\u00c9quipe Champion of Champions award in 2021. He is also a recipient of the Order of St. Sava, the Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star, and the Order of the Republika Srpska.\nBeyond competition, Djokovic is an active philanthropist and a former ATP player council president.
