She rose to fame in late 2000 when she auditioned for the German adaption of the reality television show Popstars and became a member of the girl group No Angels, one of the best-selling girl groups of European origin of all time. During their hiatus, Benaissa released her solo album, Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt (2007), which produced the single \"Ich hab dich\", and represented Hesse in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2006 with the song, finishing in fourth place.No Angels reunited in 2007. Benaissa announced her departure from the group in 2010 after she was found guilty of one count of causing grievous bodily harm and two counts of attempted bodily harm and given a two-year suspended sentence. The charges stemmed from Benaissa having unprotected sex with people who were not aware of her HIV-positive status. Months later, Benaissa released Alles wird gut, her first autobiography, and relocated to Berlin where she withdrew from the public eye to pass her Abitur exams, and qualified as an event manager.\nIn 2019, Benaissa joined the a cappella group Medlz, with whom she recorded and released two studio albums. In 2021, she left the band to re-join No Angels for their 20th anniversary celebrations."}
