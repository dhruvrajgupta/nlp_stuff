William's younger brothers are also professional wrestlers, using the ring names Dral\u00edstico and Dragon Lee. While most luchadors portray clear cut good guys or bad guys in the ring, Rush portrays a character that straddles that divide, his in-ring actions is often chaotic or brawling, with tendencies to cheat but is still popular with the fans.\nMu\u00f1oz made his in-ring debut in 2007, working under the name Latino until he started working for CMLL in 2009 where he was given the name \"Rush\". He is a former CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion, multiple time CMLL World Tag Team Champion, CMLL World Trios Champion and two-time Mexican National Trios Champion. Rush, along with La Sombra and La M\u00e1scara created the group Los Ingobernables (\"the unruly\") and he was the only original member to remain part of the group in CMLL before departing the promotion in 2019. The success of Los Ingobernables led to the formation of the Los Ingobernables de Jap\u00f3n (LIJ) group in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), which Rush was a part-time member of when he touring Japan or when LIJ toured Mexico. Through CMLL's business partnerships, Rush additionally appeared for both NJPW and the U.S. based ROH, and his CMLL contract allowed him to work dates for other companies as well, most notably Major League Wrestling in the U.S., and The Crash Lucha Libre and International Wrestling Revolution Group in Mexico."}
