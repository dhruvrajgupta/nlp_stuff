{"wikidata_id": "Q7381166", "title": "Russ Laribee", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Laribee", "summary": "Russell Kurt Laribee (born July 30, 1956) is a former professional baseball player.\nA native of Southington, Connecticut, Laribee attended Southington High School and the University of Connecticut. In 1976, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and led the league in triples with five. Drafted in the 21st round of the 1977 Draft, Laribee was a minor league outfielder. He played from 1977 through 1981 in the Boston Red Sox system, ascending as high as the team's Triple-A affiliate, the Pawtucket Red Sox. His most productive season came in 1980 with Double-A Bristol Red Sox, when he hit .302 with a .390 on-base percentage and a .508 slugging in 109 games.\nLaribee is better known as having the professional single-game strikeout record by fanning seven times in Pawtucket's 33-inning game against the Rochester Red Wings in 1981. Though Laribee is most known for that ignominious distinction, it is rarely remembered that, in the same game, it was his sacrifice fly in the bottom of the 9th inning that tied the game at 1\u20131, ultimately sending the game into extra innings. Pawtucket won, 3\u20132, while Laribee went 0-for-11.\nIn a five-season minor-league career, Laribee posted a combined .264 batting average with 57 home runs in 458 games."}
