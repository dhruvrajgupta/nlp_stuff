{"wikidata_id": "Q115812405", "title": "Elijah Wood (murderer)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Wood_(murderer)", "summary": "Elijah Green Wood (1878 \u2013 July 14, 1913) was an American murderer and accused serial killer. Convicted, sentenced to death and executed for killing a woman in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1912, he was posthumously accused by another death row inmate for three additional murders committed in 1910. Due to the fact he was already dead, Wood was never prosecuted for them and the three murders officially remain unsolved."}
