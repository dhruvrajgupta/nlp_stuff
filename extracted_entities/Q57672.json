{"wikidata_id": "Q57672", "title": "Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Augustus,_Duke_of_Brunswick", "summary": "Ernest Augustus (Ernest Augustus Christian George, German: Ernst August Christian Georg); 17 November 1887 \u2013 30 January 1953) was Duke of Brunswick from 2 November 1913 to 8 November 1918. He was a grandson of George V of Hanover, thus a Prince of Hanover and a Prince of the United Kingdom. He was also a maternal grandson of Christian IX of Denmark and the son-in-law of German Emperor Wilhelm II. The Prussians had deposed King George from the Hanoverian throne in 1866, but his marriage ended the decades-long feud between the Prussians and the Hanoverians."}
