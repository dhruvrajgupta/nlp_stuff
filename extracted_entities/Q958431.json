He was also the great-great-grandson of famous Italian-French astronomer, Giovanni Domenico Cassini, discoverer of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and the Cassini division in Saturn's rings.\nThe genus Cassinia was named in his honour by the botanist Robert Brown.\nHe named many flowering plants and new genera in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), many of them from North America.
