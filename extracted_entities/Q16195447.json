That tally included a bag of eight goals against North Melbourne at the MCG to help spoil Donald McDonald and Andrew Demetriou's 100th games. He was used mostly at half forward but played as a forward pocket in the 1989 VFL Grand Final. Cameron, along with Shane Hamilton, was traded to Brisbane in return for the first selection in the 1990 AFL draft. In 1991, his only season at the club, he kicked 26 goals."}
