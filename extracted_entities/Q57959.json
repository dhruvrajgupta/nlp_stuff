He had podium finishes in the hilly classic Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n. His victorious ride in the 1997 Tour de France led to a bicycle boom in Germany. He retired in February 2007.\nIn 2006, Ullrich was barred from the Tour de France amid speculation of having doped. In February 2012, Ullrich was found guilty of a doping offence by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He was retroactively banned from 22 August 2011, and all results gained since May 2005 were removed from his palmar\u00e8s. He admitted to blood doping in 2013."}
