{"wikidata_id": "Q551963", "title": "Louis II, Count of Loon", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_II,_Count_of_Loon", "summary": "Louis II was count of Loon between the end of the 12th century to 1218.  He was the son of Gerard, Count of Looz, and Adelaide of Gelderland, daughter of Henry I, Count of Guelders, and Agnes of Arnstein, daughter of Louis III of Arnstein. He also claimed to be the legitimate Count of Holland during the Loon War (1203\u20131206).\nHe waged war against duke Henry I of Brabant for the county of Moha and the rights on Maastricht and Sint-Truiden. He had the rights of both cities, because he was regent of Duras.  This culminated in the decisive Battle of Steppes in 1213 in which Louis prevailed.\nLouis married Ada, Countess of Holland in 1203 after her father died and she inherited Holland. She waged war against her uncle William I of Holland, to defend her inheritance of Holland. Despite her marriage to Louis for extra protection, she was taken prisoner in Leiden and brought first to Texel and then to England.\nLouis sought support from Hugo de Pierrepont, bishop of Li\u00e8ge, whom he helped to win at the battle of Steppes in 1213.\nLouis was poisoned in 1218. He was succeeded as Count of Loon by his nephew Louis III."}
