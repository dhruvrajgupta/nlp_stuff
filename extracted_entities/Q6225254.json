He was elected as Town Clerk to the City of London during the reigns of Henry V and Henry VI. He was the author of the first book of English common law, called Liber Albus (the White Book).  He was a member of the English Parliament from London in 1425.  He is also recognized as the founder of the City of London School for boys.\nHe resided in the Parish of St. Peter, Cornhill, London, and was buried in the Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster, where his wife Katherine was later interred.He is frequently distinguished in historical documents as \"John Carpenter, the younger\", \"John Carpenter, Junior\" (incorrectly), and as \"John Carpenter, Jenkin\". \"Jenkin\" or \"Jenken\" is a diminutive of the name John.John Carpenter was one of three men by that name who were prominent during the 15th century. Both others are mentioned in his will of 1442. One was his brother, John Carpenter the elder, who received much property from his younger brother.John Carpenter may have been related in some way to the other John Carpenter who was the Warden of St. Anthony's Hospital, Rector of St. Mary Magdalen's, and finally Bishop of Worcester. Bishop John Carpenter was willed, by the subject of this article, \"that book on architecture which Master William Cleve gave me\". Cleve was King's Chaplain and clerk of the works, and carried out building at the Palace of Westminster and the Tower."}
