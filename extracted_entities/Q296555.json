{"wikidata_id": "Q296555", "title": "Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_I,_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans", "summary": "Monsieur Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (21 September 1640 \u2013 9 June 1701), was the younger son of King Louis XIII of France and his wife, Anne of Austria. His elder brother was the \"Sun King\", Louis XIV. Styled Duke of Anjou from birth, Philippe became Duke of Orl\u00e9ans upon the death of his uncle Gaston in 1660. In 1661, he also received the dukedoms of Valois and Chartres. Following Philippe's victory in battle in 1671, Louis XIV granted his brother the dukedom of Nemours, the marquisates of Coucy and Folembray, and the countships of Dourdan and Romorantin.Throughout his life, Philippe was open about his preference for male lovers, most notably the Chevalier de Lorraine, and freely acted with effeminacy. He married twice, first to Henrietta of England and then to Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, fathering several children. Philippe was the founder of the House of Orl\u00e9ans, a cadet branch of the ruling House of Bourbon, and thus the direct ancestor of Louis Philippe I, who ruled France from 1830 until 1848 in the July Monarchy. The Duke was military commander at the Battle of Cassel in 1677. Through careful personal administration, he greatly augmented the fortunes of the House of Orl\u00e9ans."}
