{"wikidata_id": "Q229159", "title": "Margaret, Maid of Norway", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret,_Maid_of_Norway", "summary": "Margaret (Norwegian: Margrete, Scottish Gaelic: Maighread; March or April 1283 \u2013 September 1290), known as the Maid of Norway, was the queen-designate of Scotland from 1286 until her death. As she was never inaugurated, her status as monarch is uncertain and has been debated by historians.\nMargaret was the daughter of King Eric II of Norway and Margaret of Scotland. By the end of the reign of her maternal grandfather, King Alexander III of Scotland, she was his only surviving descendant and recognized heir presumptive. Alexander III died in 1286, his posthumous child was stillborn, and Margaret inherited the crown. \nOwing to her young age, she remained in Norway rather than going to Scotland. Her father and the Scottish leaders negotiated her marriage to Edward of Caernarfon, son of King Edward I of England. She was finally sent to Great Britain in September 1290, but died in Orkney, sparking off the succession dispute between thirteen competitors for the crown of Scotland."}
