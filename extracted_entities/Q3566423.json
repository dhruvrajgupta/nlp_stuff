Beginning in 1967, the archdiocese covered up numerous allegations of child sexual assault against Shanley and facilitated his transfers to other states.\nShanley was convicted of child rape and removed from the priesthood in 2004.  Shanley appealed his conviction in 2007 based on questions about the validity of repressed memories, but his conviction was upheld.  Shanley was incarcerated from 2005 until his release from state prison in 2017.  He died in 2020."}
