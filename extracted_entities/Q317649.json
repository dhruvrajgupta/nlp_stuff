He was the last Shaybanid Khan of Bukhara from 1583 until his death.Abdullah Khan initiated a war with Iran which lasted from 1587 to 1598. He was able to focus on this thanks to a non-aggression pact with the Mughal emperor, Akbar, through which Abdullah Khan recognized Akbar's right to rule in the territory of Kabul.\nDuring the reign of Abdullah Khan, Bukhara was also diplomatically hostile to the Khan of Yarkent, Abdul Karim Khan."}
