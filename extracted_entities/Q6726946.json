The exact date of Madeleine Truel's alliance with the French Resistance is unknown. She worked as a document forger. She was captured in 1944 and was tortured to extract information without success, following which she was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1945. She died in Stolpe (Germany) on 3 May 1945, after the so-called \"death march\", a few hours before the Russian troops arrived. Her full name, Madeleine Blanche Pauline Truel Larrabure, appears on a monument in homage to all those who were deported from France and perished during the Second World War."}
