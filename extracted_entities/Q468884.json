{"wikidata_id": "Q468884", "title": "Ella Baker", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Baker", "summary": "Ella Josephine Baker (December 13, 1903 \u2013 December 13, 1986) was an African-American civil rights and human rights activist. She was a largely behind-the-scenes organizer whose career spanned more than five decades. In New York City and the South, she worked alongside some of the most noted civil rights leaders of the 20th century, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, A. Philip Randolph, and Martin Luther King Jr. She also mentored many emerging activists, such as Diane Nash, Stokely Carmichael, and Bob Moses, as leaders in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).Baker criticized professionalized, charismatic leadership; she promoted grassroots organizing, radical democracy, and the ability of the oppressed to understand their worlds and advocate for themselves. She realized this vision most fully in the 1960s as the primary advisor and strategist of the SNCC. Biographer Barbara Ransby calls Baker \"one of the most important American leaders of the twentieth century and perhaps the most influential woman in the civil rights movement\". She is known for her critiques of both racism in American culture and sexism in the civil rights movement."}
