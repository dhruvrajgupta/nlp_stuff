{"wikidata_id": "Q9327", "title": "Guy de Maupassant", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_de_Maupassant", "summary": "Henri Ren\u00e9 Albert Guy de Maupassant (UK: , US: ; French: [\u0261i d(\u0259) mopas\u0251\u0303]; 5 August 1850 \u2013 6 July 1893) was a 19th-century French author, remembered as a master of the short story form, as well as a representative of the Naturalist school, who depicted human lives, destinies and social forces in disillusioned and often pessimistic terms.\nMaupassant was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gustave Flaubert and his stories are characterized by economy of style and efficient, seemingly effortless d\u00e9nouements. Many are set during the Franco-Prussian War of the 1870s, describing the futility of war and the innocent civilians who, caught up in events beyond their control, are permanently changed by their experiences. He wrote  300 short stories, six novels, three travel books, and one volume of verse. His first published story, \"Boule de Suif\" (\"The Dumpling\", 1880), is often considered his most famous work."}
