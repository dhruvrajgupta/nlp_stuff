From 28 July to 4 September 1870, she was the De facto head of state of France.\nBorn to prominent Spanish nobility, Eug\u00e9nie was educated in France, Spain, and England. As Empress, she used her influence to champion \"authoritarian and clerical policies\"; her involvement in politics earned her much criticism from contemporaries. Napol\u00e9on and Eug\u00e9nie had one child together, Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial (1856\u201379). After the fall of the Empire, the three lived in exile in England; Eug\u00e9nie outlived both her husband and son and spent the remainder of her life working to commemorate their memories and the memory of the Second Empire."}
