Pardon.In 1988, he was awarded a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, and went to conduct research on singularities at Northeastern University. In 1991, he assumed a regular faculty position in the Mathematics Department at Northeastern. He has remained at Northeastern University ever since, where he is now a full professor.He has published over 35 research-level papers and two research-level books and written four Calculus textbooks.  He is the editor-in-chief of an open-access journal, the Journal of Singularities.In the fall of 2008, Massey founded the Worldwide Center of Mathematics, which is an independent research and learning center for mathematics located in Cambridge, MA."}
