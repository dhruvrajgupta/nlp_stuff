{"wikidata_id": "Q332105", "title": "Jacques Charles", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Charles", "summary": "Jacques Alexandre C\u00e9sar Charles (12 November 1746 \u2013 7 April 1823) was a French inventor, scientist, mathematician, and balloonist.\nCharles wrote almost nothing about mathematics, and most of what has been credited to him was due to mistaking him with another Jacques Charles, also a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, entering on 12 May 1785. He was sometimes called Charles the Geometer.Charles and the Robert brothers launched the world's first hydrogen-filled gas balloon in August 1783; then in December 1783, Charles and his co-pilot Nicolas-Louis Robert ascended to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m) in a piloted gas balloon. Their pioneering use of hydrogen for lift led to this type of balloon being named a Charli\u00e8re (as opposed to a Montgolfi\u00e8re which used hot air).\nCharles's law, describing how gases tend to expand when heated, was formulated by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802, but he credited it to unpublished work by Charles.Charles was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in 1795 and subsequently became professor of physics at the Acad\u00e9mie de Sciences."}
