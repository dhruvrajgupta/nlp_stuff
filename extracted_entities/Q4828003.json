He and his first wife, Nina van Pallandt, created a sensation first in Denmark and then elsewhere in Europe with music rooted in folk, ethnic, and calypso styles and, at first, their plain stage attire.\nThe couple had three children: Floris Nicolas Ali, Baron van Pallandt (10 June 1961 \u2013 13 October 2006), Kirsa Eleonore Clara, Baroness van Pallandt (born 9 August 1963), and Ana Maria Else, Baroness van Pallandt (born 30 October 1965) and continued their musical careers until they parted in 1969, with their marriage eventually dissolved in 1976. The following year, on 10 May, van Pallandt married Mar\u00eda Jesus de Los Rios y Coello de Portugal. Together, they had one child: Daniel Tilopa, Baron van Pallandt, who was born 12 May 1977.  In 1984, van Pallandt bought Burke's Peerage from The Holdway Group.According to his first wife's memoir, van Pallandt was an avid sailor, and settled in the Philippines in the 1990s. He became involved with an Australian syndicate involved in the trafficking of cannabis, using his yacht the Tiaping to transport the shipments. On 15 May 1994, both he and his Filipina girlfriend Susannah were shot dead in a hut at Puerto Galera in the Philippines. The murderer is believed to have been another member of the syndicate. He was buried near his parents' grave in IJhorst in the Netherlands."}
