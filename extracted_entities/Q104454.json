Although his favoured position is that of a playmaker, G\u00f6tze has also played as a false nine or as an emergency striker.He played for Borussia Dortmund between 2009 and 2013, winning the Bundesliga title in 2010\u201311 and the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2011\u201312, and was a member of the team which reached the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. In April 2013, a \u20ac37 million bid from Bayern Munich triggered a release clause in G\u00f6tze's contract, making him the second-most expensive German player at the time, behind Mesut \u00d6zil. He spent three seasons with the club where he won a further three league titles, two DFB-Pokal trophies and a winners' medal in each of the FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup. He then returned to Dortmund in 2016, where he added another DFB-Pokal title and a DFL-Supercup to his name.\nG\u00f6tze was first selected for the Germany national football team in 2010, at the age of 18. He was included in the squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and, two years later, scored the winning goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final."}
