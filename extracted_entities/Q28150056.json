Mayl\u00e4nder acquired the work of many young Austrian artists, including many drawings by Egon Schiele whom he knew personally.Art by Schiele owned by Mayl\u00e4nder has been the subject of restitution claims by his descendant in New York, Eva Zirkl. In 2010, an Austrian commission set up by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Arts, Education, and Culture investigated the ownership history, or provenance, of five paintings by Egon Schiele: \"Girl with Sunglasses\", \"Portrait of Olga Gallus\", \"Proletrairan Children\", \"Portrait of Heinrich Benesch\", and 'Portrait of a boy\" and recommended that the paintings be restituted to Mayl\u00e4nder's heirs. However the commission had no authority to force a private museum like th eLeopold Museum to follow its recommendations. In 2016, after negociations, the Leopold Museum in Vienna agreed to return two of the five watercolour paintings by Schiele to Zirkl."}
