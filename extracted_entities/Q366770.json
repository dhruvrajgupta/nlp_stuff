{"wikidata_id": "Q366770", "title": "Johnnie Parsons", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Parsons", "summary": "John Woodrow Parsons (July 4, 1918 \u2013  September 8, 1984) was an American race car driver from Los Angeles, California who won the Indianapolis 500 in 1950.\nDuring his racing career, he drove for several seasons, including his AAA championship and Indianapolis 500 win, for Ed Walsh's team. Walsh was an owner of Kurtis Kraft, the leading constructor of AAA championship cars. Parsons was a charger, needing cars to race against, frequently moving from last on the grid to a win in spectacular displays of dirt track driving ability. \nJohnnie Parsons had the dubious distinction of being the only Indianapolis 500 winner to have his name misspelled on the Borg-Warner Trophy. The silversmith carved \"Johnny\" instead of \"Johnnie.\" He had a son named Johnny who competed at Indy a dozen times. In 1991, during a trophy restoration project, it was proposed to correct the spelling, albeit posthumously. However, it was decided to keep the error intact, as part of the trophy's lore."}
