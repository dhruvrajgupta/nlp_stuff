{"wikidata_id": "Q37327", "title": "Samuel Beckett", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett", "summary": "Samuel Barclay Beckett (; 13 April 1906 \u2013 22 December 1989) was an Irish novelist, dramatist, short story writer, theatre director, poet, and literary translator. His literary and theatrical work features bleak, impersonal and tragicomic experiences of life, often coupled with black comedy and nonsense. His work became increasingly minimalist as his career progressed, involving more aesthetic and linguistic experimentation, with techniques of repetition and self-reference. He is considered one of the last modernist writers, and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the Theatre of the Absurd.A resident of Paris for most of his adult life, Beckett wrote in both French and English. During the Second World War, Beckett was a member of the French Resistance group Gloria SMH (R\u00e9seau Gloria) and was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1949.  He was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his writing, which\u2014in new forms for the novel and drama\u2014in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation\". In 1961 he shared the inaugural Prix International with Jorge Luis Borges. He was the first person to be elected Saoi of Aosd\u00e1na in 1984."}
