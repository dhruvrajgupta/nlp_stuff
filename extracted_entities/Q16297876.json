He first ran as an independent candidate in 2013, and then as part of the Broad Front coalition in 2017. Boric is a founding member of Social Convergence, which is one of the parties that make up the Broad Front.During the 2019 civil unrest in Chile, Boric played a key role in negotiating the agreement that led to a constitutional referendum. Although the more progressive constitution that he supported was ultimately rejected, Boric was selected as the presidential candidate of the Apruebo Dignidad coalition. This coalition was composed of the Broad Front, the Communist Party, and other smaller movements. Boric won the presidential primary election with 60% of the popular vote and went on to defeat Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast in the second round of the presidential election, securing 55.9% of the votes. As a result, Boric became the youngest president in Chilean history and currently is the second youngest state leader in the world, after Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso."}
