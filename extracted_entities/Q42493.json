Known for her influence on modern pop music and her campy style, she has been referred to as the \"Queen of Camp\" by Vogue. Pursuing a career in gospel music at 16, Perry released her debut album, Katy Hudson, under Red Hill Records in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles at 17 to venture into secular music, and later adopted the stage name \"Katy Perry\" from her mother's maiden name. She recorded an album while signed to Columbia Records, but was dropped before signing to Capitol Records.\nShe rose to fame with One of the Boys (2008), a pop rock record containing her debut single \"I Kissed a Girl\" and follow-up single \"Hot n Cold\", which reached number one and three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 respectively. The disco-influenced pop album Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five U.S. number one singles\u2014\"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\"\u2014becoming the only album by a female singer to do so. A reissue of the album titled Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection (2012) subsequently produced the U.S. number one single \"Part of Me\". Her empowerment-themed album Prism (2013) had two U.S. number one singles \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". Both their respective music videos made Perry the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo. The electropop album Witness (2017) featured themes of feminism and a political subtext, while Smile (2020) was influenced by her recent motherhood and mental health journey. Afterwards, she embarked on her Las Vegas concert residency titled Play (2021\u2013present), receiving critical acclaim and commercial success.\nPerry is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 143 million records worldwide.
