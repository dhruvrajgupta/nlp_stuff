He was part of the squad in seven major tournaments, winning the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He is the third most-capped player in German history, with 130 caps, and the third-highest goalscorer in German history, having scored 49 times.On 29 May 2013, Podolski scored the fastest goal in German national team history, after just nine seconds of the 4\u20132 friendly win over Ecuador.

Podolski retired from international football on 22 March 2017 after scoring the winner in a friendly against England."}
