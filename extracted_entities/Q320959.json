{"wikidata_id": "Q320959", "title": "Robert Blake (admiral)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Blake_(admiral)", "summary": "Robert Blake (27 September 1598 \u2013 17 August 1657) was an English naval officer who served as the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1656 to 1657. Blake is recognized as the chief founder of England's naval supremacy, a dominance subsequently inherited by the British Royal Navy well into the early 20th century. Despite this, due to deliberate attempts to expunge the Parliamentarians from historical records following the Stuart Restoration, Blake's achievements tend to remain unrecognized. Blake's successes have been considered to have \"never been excelled, not even by Nelson\" according to one biographer."}
