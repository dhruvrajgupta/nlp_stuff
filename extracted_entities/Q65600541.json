{"wikidata_id": "Q65600541", "title": "Kari Lake", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "summary": "Kari Ann Lake ( KAIR-ee; born August 23, 1969) is an American former television news anchor and political figure who was the Republican nominee in the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election.\nBeginning her media career in the early 1990s, Lake was the anchor for the Phoenix television station KSAZ-TV from 1999 to 2021. She stepped down from her anchor role shortly before announcing her gubernatorial candidacy and won the Republican nomination with the endorsement of former president Donald Trump. Her campaign was marked by various controversies, including promoting false claims of Trump winning the 2020 presidential election and calling for the imprisonment of those who accepted Trump's defeat, including her Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Lake lost the gubernatorial election to Hobbs, but refused to concede and filed a lawsuit in an attempt to have the results overturned and herself declared the winner. Most of her lawsuit has been rejected by all three levels of Arizona's state courts, but one part is still under consideration."}
