{"wikidata_id": "Q6531004", "title": "Leslie Marshall (cricketer)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Marshall_(cricketer)", "summary": "Leslie Phillips Marshall MC MD TD (25 January 1894 \u2013 28 February 1978) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Somerset between 1913 and 1931. He was born at Chennai, India, then called Madras, and died at Taunton, Somerset.\nEducated at Taunton School, Marshall played in three first-class matches for Somerset at the age of 19 in 1913, but a score of 26 against Derbyshire was his only success. His schooling was interrupted in 1914 when he joined the British forces serving overseas. He was discharged at the end of the war after receiving shrapnel wounds to the leg and buttock. He then made one first-class appearance in each of the 1914, 1919, 1926 and 1928 seasons, making little impact and, while a student at Cambridge University, he also appeared in one of the non-first-class trials matches in 1919, though he did not appear for the University side in any first-class games.In 1931, he returned for four matches, the most he played in any one season, and in his final match, against the New Zealanders, he twice improved his highest score, made 18 years earlier, with 29 in the first innings and 37 in the second."}
