{"wikidata_id": "Q273055", "title": "R. Kelly", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Kelly", "summary": "Robert Sylvester Kelly (born January 8, 1967), better known as R. Kelly, is an American musician, convicted felon, racketeer, and sex offender. Kelly sold more than 75 million records worldwide. He won three Grammys for his song \"I Believe I Can Fly\", and was also nominated for his song \"You Are Not Alone\" recorded by Michael Jackson. Critics dubbed him \"the King of R&B\" while he billed himself the \"Pied Piper of R&B\".Investigations by law enforcement and journalists revealed that Kelly used his fame to seek out underage fans for sex. Video recordings of these encounters led the Cook County State's Attorney to prosecute him for child pornography. Kelly won acquittal in 2008. Testifying years later, a victim depicted in the video testified to Kelly using bribes and threats to stop her and her family from pressing charges. Kelly's lawyer, Ed Genson, told the Chicago Sun-Times Kelly was \"guilty as hell\".\nThe 2019 documentary television series Surviving R. Kelly reexamined accusations of Kelly's sexual misconduct with minors, triggering a backlash and leading RCA Records to terminate their contract with him. Law enforcement pursued new criminal cases in multiple jurisdictions, resulting in Kelly's arrest on July 2019.  A 2021 trial in Brooklyn federal court convicted Kelly for violations of the Mann Act and racketeering. A 2022 trial in Chicago federal court convicted him for three child pornography charges and three charges of enticing a minor. He was sentenced to serve 31 years imprisonment in a combination of concurrent and consecutive sentences. As of 2023, he is an inmate of Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago. He continues to challenge his two convictions."}
