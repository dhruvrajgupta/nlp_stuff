{"wikidata_id": "Q57241", "title": "Hans Modrow", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Modrow", "summary": "Hans Modrow (German pronunciation: [\u02c8hans \u02c8mo\u02d0d\u0281o]; 27 January 1928 \u2013 10 February 2023) was a German politician best known as the last communist premier of East Germany.\nTaking office in the middle of the Peaceful Revolution, he was the de facto leader of the country for much of the winter of 1989 and 1990. He was a transitional figure, paving the way to the first and only free elections in East Germany and including many opposition politicians in his cabinet. \nAfter the end of Communist rule and reunification of Germany, he was convicted of electoral fraud and perjury by the Dresden District Court in 1995, on the basis that he had been the SED official nominally in charge of the electoral process. He was later convicted of the first charge and was given a nine-month suspended sentence. One of the few high-ranking former SED officials to not have been expelled, he was the honorary chairman of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and was the president of the \"council of elders\" of the Left Party from 2007."}
