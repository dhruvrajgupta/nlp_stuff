He was awarded the Grandmaster title by FIDE on January 22, 2021. In July 2021, he won the World Open chess tournament in Philadelphia. Niemann first entered the Top 100 Junior players list at position 88 on March 1, 2019. As of February 2023, he is the fourth-highest-rated Junior in the world and 35th overall.Niemann is currently embroiled in an ongoing cheating controversy that began after he defeated world champion Magnus Carlsen in the third round of the 2022 Sinquefield Cup. Carlsen initially made no direct accusation, but did post a cryptic tweet, which together with ramped-up security measures in the fourth round implied an accusation of cheating. Niemann admitted to cheating in online chess twice, when he was 12 and 16 years old, but denied cheating over the board. Carlsen eventually accused Niemann of cheating in a statement on September 26. Later, Chess.com published an article called \"The Hans Niemann Report\" which stated that Niemann has likely cheated in more than 100 games on the website, of which some were prized events. In response, Niemann filed a $100 million defamation lawsuit against Magnus Carlsen, Chess.com and Hikaru Nakamura."}
