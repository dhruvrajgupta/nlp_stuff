After finishing a telegraph school in Riga in 1871, he worked at the telegraph offices in Moscow and Crimea. He returned to Lithuania in 1884 and joined the Lithuanian cultural life. He contributed articles to the illegal Lithuanian periodicals Varpas and \u016akininkas and his house was a gathering place of many Lithuanian intellectuals. Due to these activities, he was forced to leave Lithuania in 1894 but continued to maintain contacts with Lithuanian activists. He was arrested and imprisoned for ten weeks in 1900 and sentenced to two years of exile in Smolensk in 1902. He returned in 1904 and became administrator of Vilniaus \u017einios, the first legal Lithuanian daily established by Petras Vilei\u0161is. At the same time, Landsbergis devoted his energy to the Lithuanian amateur theater. He was a director, actor, playwright, critic of many of the early performances. He founded and chaired the Kankl\u0117s of Vilnius Society and was active in the R\u016bta Society in Vilnius, Daina Society in Kaunas, and Varpas Society in \u0160iauliai. All of these societies organized Lithuanian theater performances, concerts, other cultural evenings. In total, he directed or played a role in more than 130 plays. Landsbergis also wrote several plays, mostly simple comedies that were well suited for the amateur theater. His most important works were a drama about Lithuanian folk hero Tadas Blinda (1907) and melodrama about Grand Duchess Birut\u0117 (1906) which was later adapted into the first Lithuanian opera Birut\u0117."}
