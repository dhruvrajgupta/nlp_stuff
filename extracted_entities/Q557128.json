He was great-grandson of Juan Albano Pereira M\u00e1rquez.He studied at the Instituto Nacional and later graduated as a lawyer from the Universidad de Chile. He was accepted to the bar on May 18, 1869. On August 16, 1871, he married Mercedes Bara\u00f1ao Ochagav\u00eda.He was elected Deputy for Lontu\u00e9 in 1885 and reelected in 1891. In 1894 he was elected for the Talca, Curepto and Lontu\u00e9 district. Fern\u00e1ndez was twice Minister of Industry and Public Works under President Jorge Montt (1894-1896); Minister of War and Navy (1896\u201397), Finance (1897) and Interior (1899-1900) under Federico Err\u00e1zuriz Echaurren, and again minister of Interior under Germ\u00e1n Riesco Err\u00e1zuriz (1902-1903).In 1910, President Pedro Montt Montt, seriously ill, took a leave of absence and moved to Germany for treatment, which proved unsuccessful, and Fern\u00e1ndez, as Minister of the Interior, served during Montt's absence and became acting president upon Montt's death on August 16, 1910.  Fern\u00e1ndez, however, caught a cold during Montt's funeral, which soon turned into pulmonary, causing him to die of heart failure in Santiago de Chile on September 6, 1910, after only three weeks in office."}
