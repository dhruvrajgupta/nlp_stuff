He rose to power as dictator after toppling the president Arturo Illia in a coup d'\u00e9tat self-named Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina.\nOngan\u00eda wanted to install in Argentina a paternalistic dictatorship modeled on the Spanish Francisco Franco. While preceding military coups in Argentina were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional juntas, the Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina headed by Ongan\u00eda aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to liberal democracy and to communism, which gave to the Armed Forces of Argentina a leading role in the political and economic operation of the country. Ongan\u00eda implemented a rigid censorship that reached the press and all cultural manifestations such as cinema, theater and even poetry.When the Armed Forces replaced the radical president in government with General Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda, they interrupted an attempt to set up the republic and led the country to the violence of the 1970s and subsequent decline."}
