{"wikidata_id": "Q6305905", "title": "Jules Jammal", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Jammal", "summary": "Jules Yusuf Jammal (Arabic: \u062c\u0648\u0644 \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644) is said to have been a Syrian military officer who killed himself in a suicide attack during the Suez Crisis, in Egypt.\nAccording to a narrative prevailing in the Arab world, Jammal rammed his boat into a French warship, thereby sinking the ship. This story is given credence in some sources. However, as related in the 1967 book Six days in June: Israel's fight for survival by Washington correspondent and historian Robert J. Donovan, the tale is false but gained traction in the Arab world after being aired on Radio Cairo. It is cited as an example of the \"potency of [the station] to propagate myths [as being] beyond dispute.\""}
