He served under Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2005 to 2012 and as Minister of Health and Care Services from 2012 to 2013. He has been a Member of the Storting for Oslo since 2009.\nSt\u00f8re grew up in West End Oslo and is a multimillionaire. He underwent naval officer training at the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy and then studied political science at Sciences Po in Paris from 1981 to 1985. Originally associated with the Conservative Party, he was a career special adviser and director-general in the Prime Minister's Office from 1989 to 1997, serving under prime ministers Jan Syse, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland. He became known as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Brundtland in the 1990s, and her mentorship inspired him to become a member of the Labour Party in 1995. In 1998, he followed Brundtland to the World Health Organization, where he became her chief of staff. St\u00f8re was State Secretary and Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office in the first government of Jens Stoltenberg; the government was inspired by New Labour and oversaw the most widespread privatization in Norwegian history. He later served as Secretary-General of the Norwegian Red Cross from 2003 to 2005. Like his political mentors Brundtland and Stoltenberg, St\u00f8re is associated with the business-friendly right-wing of the Labour Party. When he joined the cabinet in 2005, he was perceived as part of a group of \"West End executives\" and confidants of Stoltenberg that represented a shift to the right. His tenure as foreign minister nevertheless made him the most popular member of the cabinet.Despite the Labour Party receiving 1% fewer votes and losing one seat, the centre-left won a majority in the 2021 Norwegian parliamentary election. As the leader of the largest party, St\u00f8re was the clear favourite for the role of prime minister. Two days after the resignation of Erna Solberg and her government on 12 October 2021, St\u00f8re was appointed as prime minister by King Harald V, leading a minority government with the Centre Party."}
