Officers pulled Nichols from his car, and maced and tasered him. Nichols broke free and ran toward his mother's house, which was less than a mile (1.6 km) away. Five Black officers caught up with Nichols near the house, where they assaulted him. Medics on the scene failed to administer care for 16 minutes after arriving. Nichols was admitted to the hospital in critical condition, where he died three days later.\nThe officers reported that they stopped Nichols for reckless driving. MPD released four edited video clips from police body cameras and a nearby pole-mounted camera. MPD Police Chief Cerelyn J. Davis later stated that the department had reviewed camera footage and could not find any evidence of probable cause for the traffic stop.\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Justice both opened investigations into the incident. A coroner's report has not been released. A private autopsy commissioned by Nichols family attorneys indicated that Nichols experienced \"extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating.\"\nThe five officers who battered Nichols were terminated from MPD, effective January 8, 2023. They were arrested and charged on January 26 with several crimes including second degree murder. They have all pled not guilty. MPD has disciplined, relieved of duty, dismissed, or arrested thirteen officers in total regarding their conduct. Memphis Fire Services terminated three employees for their failure to evaluate or assist Nichols. After the release of the videos, widespread protests began on January 27."}
