He also served as the prime minister of Montenegro (1991\u20131998, 2003\u20132006, 2008\u20132010 and 2012\u20132016) and was the long-term president of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, originally the Montenegrin branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which governed Montenegro alone or in a coalition from the introduction of multi-party politics in the early 1990s until its defeat in the 2020 parliamentary election. He is the longest-ruling contemporary politician in Europe, having held key positions in the country for over 33 years.\nWhen \u0110ukanovi\u0107 first emerged on the political scene, he was a close ally of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 during the anti-bureaucratic revolution (1988\u20131989) and the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia (1991\u20131992). His cabinet actively participated in the siege of Dubrovnik (1991\u20131992). \u0110ukanovi\u0107 supported Momir Bulatovi\u0107's agreement on Lord Carrington's terms, which resulted in the 1992 Montenegrin independence referendum, where voters decided to remain in FR Yugoslavia. In 1996, however, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 distanced himself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and the federal government, abandoning the traditional joint Serbian and Montenegrin vision in favour of Montenegrin nationalism, which supported the state independence and a separate Montenegrin identity. That led to the division of the party and the split of the Bulatovi\u0107's pro-unionist faction. Shortly afterward, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 defeated Bulatovi\u0107 in the 1997 presidential election by a thin margin. In 1999, he negotiated with western countries in an attempt to limit airstrikes in Montenegro during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, while later \u0110ukanovi\u0107 oversaw the implementation of the Deutsche Mark as the new currency in Montenegro, replacing the Yugoslav dinar.\nFollowing the overthrow of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (2000), he signed an agreement with the new Serbian government that led to the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro (2003), which allowed for Montenegrin independence. Three years later, the 2006 independence referendum led to a formal separation from the state union and the proclamation of the new Constitution of Montenegro (2007). \u0110ukanovi\u0107 has pursued NATO and EU accession policy, resulting in Montenegro's NATO membership in 2017. Over the course of his premiership and presidency, he oversaw the privatization of public companies to foreign investors and firms. Several corruption scandals of the ruling party triggered 2019 anti-government protests, while a controversial religion law sparked another wave of protests. For the first time in three decades, in the 2020 parliamentary election, the opposition won more votes than \u0110ukanovi\u0107's ruling party and its partners.\nSome observers have described \u0110ukanovi\u0107's rule as authoritarian or autocratic, as well as a kleptocracy. His brother Aco \u0110ukanovi\u0107, the owner of Montenegro's first private bank, had the upper hand in privatisations, while his sister, the lawyer Ana Kolarevic, controlled the judiciary for a long time. DPS clientelist networks dominated all segments of social life, making party membership necessary to start a business or obtain a position in the administration. In 2020, the Freedom House classified Montenegro as a hybrid regime rather than a democracy, mentioning the years of increasing state capture, abuse of power, and strongman tactics employed by \u0110ukanovi\u0107. He is often described as having strong links to the Montenegrin mafia. \u0110ukanovi\u0107 was listed among the twenty richest world leaders according to the British newspaper The Independent in May 2010, which described the source of his estimated \u00a310 million wealth as \"mysterious\". In October 2021, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 and his son Bla\u017eo were mentioned in Pandora Papers, linking them to two trusts on British Virgin Islands."}
