{"wikidata_id": "Q230744", "title": "Anna Wintour", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "summary": "Dame Anna Wintour  (; born 3 November 1949) is a British journalist based in New York City who has served as editor-in-Chief of Vogue since 1988 and Global Chief Content Officer for Cond\u00e9 Nast since 2020; she is also the artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast and the Global Editorial Director of Vogue. With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and dark sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, praised for her eye for emerging fashion trends. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname \"Nuclear Wintour\".\nHer father, Charles Wintour, Editor of the London Evening Standard (1959\u20131976), consulted with her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the US, with stints at New York and House & Garden. She returned to London and was the editor of British Vogue between 1985 and 1987. A year later, she assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.\nA former personal assistant, Lauren Weisberger, wrote the 2003 bestselling roman \u00e0 clef The Devil Wears Prada, later made into a successful 2006 film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a fashion editor, believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009, Wintour was the focus of a documentary film, R. J. Cutler's The September Issue."}
