This has led to allegations of cronyism, as his firms have won many  energy and infrastructure  contracts in India and abroad after Modi became the Prime Minister of India. In January 2023, following accusations of stock manipulation and fraud by American short selling activist firm Hindenburg Research, Adani's and his family's  fortune has plummeted by over 50% to an estimated US$50.2 billion, as of March 2023, while falling to the 24th place on the Forbes Real Time Billionaires list."}
