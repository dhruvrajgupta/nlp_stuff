As a young man, he moved to Norway as a Hungarian refugee, eventually moving to the United States to pursue a career as a pilot, which eventually led to a career in film. While he acted in mainstream films, he was a look-alike  for Burt Reynolds and Sean Connery, which popularized him in adult films, including parodies. He started making pornography at age 38 and retired in his sixties, with over 500 films in his canon. Labelled Norway's most famous porn actor by Morgenbladet, the three-times-married Gabor was described as \"a womanizing alcoholic who played accordion, spoke eight languages, and was one of Ron Jeremy's best friends.\""}
