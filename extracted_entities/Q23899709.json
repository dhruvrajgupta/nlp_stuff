{"wikidata_id": "Q23899709", "title": "Jaime Ram\u00edrez (police officer)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Ram%C3%ADrez_(police_officer)", "summary": "Jaime Ram\u00edrez G\u00f3mez (July 4, 1940 \u2013 November 17, 1986) was an official of the National Police of Colombia, who led a fight against the illegal drug trade in Colombia from the 1970s onwards.\nHe became the national director of the Colombian drug enforcement unit, working with the Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla against the Medell\u00edn Cartel. The biggest blow against the cartel was dealt by Colonel Ram\u00edrez (later Brigadier General) on March 7, 1984, in an operation involving the DEA to locate and destroy a large cocaine production camp in the jungle of the Yari River (between the departments of Caqueta and Meta) known by the cartel as \"Tranquilandia\" (the \"Tranquil Land\"). It triggered direct hostilities by the cartel against the Colombian state, commencing with the murders of Minister Lara Bonilla on April 30, 1984, and Colonel Jaime Ram\u00edrez G\u00f3mez two years later.\nThe importance of Ram\u00edrez's fight against the drug traffickers has been highlighted years after his murder, due to the damage caused by drug cartels to both Colombian and international communities. On August 10, 1992, almost six years after the murder of Ram\u00edrez, the President of Colombia decreed that he should receive a posthumous promotion to Brigadier General, a position that was due to be given to him one month after his murder."}
