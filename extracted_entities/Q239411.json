She was a senior advisor in his administration, and also was the director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship. She is the daughter of Trump's first wife, Ivana, and is the first Jewish member of an American first family, having converted before marrying her Jewish husband, Jared Kushner.She was an executive vice president of the family-owned Trump Organization. She was also a boardroom judge on her father's TV show, The Apprentice. Starting in March 2017, Trump left the Trump Organization to become a senior adviser in her father's presidential administration alongside Jared Kushner. After ethics concerns were raised about her having access to classified material while not being held to the same restrictions as a federal employee, Trump agreed to voluntarily file \"financial disclosure forms required of federal employees and be bound by the same ethics rules\". While serving in the White House, she continued to operate her clothing brand business until July 2018, which also raised ethics concerns, specifically conflicts of interest. Trump was considered part of the president's inner circle even before becoming an official employee in his administration."}
