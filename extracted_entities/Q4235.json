Her music spans across varied styles and genres, including pop, country, rock, hip hop, R&B, and experimental music.\nThe third daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, she emerged as a teen idol while portraying the title character of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006\u20132011). As Hannah Montana, she attained two number-one and three top-five soundtracks on the Billboard 200, and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single \"He Could Be the One\". Cyrus' initial solo career consisted of the teen-friendly pop rock U.S. number-one albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) and Breakout (2008); these releases contained the US top-ten singles \"See You Again\" and \"7 Things\".

Supported by the top-five single \"We Can't Stop\" and the chart-topping \"Wrecking Ball\", it became her fifth number-one album and earned Cyrus her first Grammy Award nomination. She experimented with psychedelic music on her follow-up, the free album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), before exploring country pop on Younger Now (2017), which contained the U.S. top-ten single \"Malibu\", and trap on the EP She Is Coming (2019). Plastic Hearts (2020) saw Cyrus venture into rock and glam rock; the record became her first number-one entry on the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart. In 2021, Cyrus collaborated with The Kid Laroi on a remix of his single, \"Without You\".
