Whereas contemporary scientists scoffed at the idea of human flight, Zhukovsky was the first to undertake the study of airflow. He is often called the Father of Russian Aviation.\nThe Joukowsky transform is named after him, while the fundamental aerodynamical theorem, the Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem, is named after both him and German mathematician Martin Kutta."}
