The band has been marketed with three different names on different releases, g//z/r in 1995, geezer in 1997, and GZR in 2005. Most fans refer to the band as \"geezer,\" although Butler himself refers to the band name as \"gee-zed-R\". This incarnation of the band is not to be confused with Butler's previous attempt in 1985 to form a solo band, then known as the Geezer Butler Band \u2013 the two outfits are largely unrelated."}
