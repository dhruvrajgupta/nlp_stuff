He interprets his artist name as \"super-intelligentes Drogenopfer\" (super-intelligent drug victim). It used to stand for \"Schei\u00dfe in dein Ohr\" (shit into your ear), a line from his track \"Terroarr\".Sido distinguishes himself by using provocative and aggressive lyrics. After his breakthrough with his debut album Maske in 2004, he was always seen wearing a silver skull mask. However, since 2005, he no longer wears the mask.\nW\u00fcrdig's career began in 1997, as one half of duo Royal TS (now A.i.d.S) with B-Tight, both of whom were later signed to the label Berlin hip hop Royal Bunker and then to Aggro Berlin in 2001. As of 2009, Sido is signed to Urban/Universal Music Group."}
