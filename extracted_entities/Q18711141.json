Mar\u00eda was also niece of Mar\u00eda Josefa Garc\u00eda Granados, an influential poet and journalist of the time. When Cuban poet and patriot Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed came to Guatemala in 1877, he was invited to General Garcia Granados gatherings and fell in love with Maria there, but could not act on this love because he was already engaged to marry Ms. Carmen Zayas Baz\u00e1n. Mar\u00eda died in 1878, shortly after learning that Mart\u00ed had married, and he immortalized her in his 1891 poem La Ni\u00f1a de Guatemala."}
