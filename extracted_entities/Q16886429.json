Kilman set up a coalition government, which did not include Wango, and the latter eventually defected to the Opposition. In February 2011, as the Opposition prepared a motion of no confidence against Kilman's premiership, the Prime Minister secured his majority by offering Wango a position in Cabinet. Wango joined the government as Minister for Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries and Quarantine.Kilman was eventually ousted in a vote of no confidence on 24 April 2011, however, and Wango lost his position in government. He recovered it three weeks later, on 13 May, when the Court of Appeal voided the election of Serge Vohor's new government on constitutional grounds, and the Kilman government was restored. This lasted for only a month; on 15 June, the Kilman premiership was itself voided on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court's Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, and Wango lost office once more.\n\n\n== References =="}
