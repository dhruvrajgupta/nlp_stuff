{"wikidata_id": "Q151209", "title": "Anne of Austria", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Austria", "summary": "Anne of Austria (French: Anne d'Autriche, Spanish: Ana Mar\u00eda Mauricia; 22 September 1601 \u2013 20 January 1666) was an infanta of Spain who became Queen of France as the wife of King Louis XIII from their marriage in 1615 until Louis XIII died in 1643. She was also Queen of Navarre until that kingdom was annexed into the French crown in 1620. After her husband's death, Anne was regent to her son Louis XIV, during his minority, until 1651. During her regency, Cardinal Mazarin served as France's chief minister. Accounts of French court life of Anne's era emphasize her difficult marital relations with her husband, her closeness to her son, and her disapproval of her son's marital infidelity to her niece and daughter-in-law Maria Theresa."}
