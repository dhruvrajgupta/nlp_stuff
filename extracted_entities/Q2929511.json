She served as regent of the remnants of the County of Edessa in the absence of her spouse in 1150. \nHer first husband, William of Zardana, died in 1132 or 1133, leaving her in the possession of the fortress of Saone in the Principality of Antioch. She soon married her late husband's close ally Count Joscelin II of Edessa. \nAfter her husband was captured by troops of Nur ad-Din, the atabeg (or governor) of Aleppo in May 1150, Beatrice became regent in the absence of her spouse. She entered into negotiations about the sale of the remnants of the County of Edessa to the Byzantine Empire. \nAfter the transfer was completed in August 1150, she and her children settled in Saone."}
