{"wikidata_id": "Q7358079", "title": "Roger Davis (cricketer)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Davis_(cricketer)", "summary": "Roger Clive Davis (born 15 January 1946) is a Welsh former county cricketer who played for Glamorgan for 13 years as an all-rounder. While having a quiet career from his debut in 1964 until 1970, he then enjoyed five years of greater success, including scoring over 1,000 runs in the 1975 season, before a rapid decline in 1976 which saw him dropped from the team. He nevertheless enjoyed a successful career, with over 7,000 runs and 241 wickets in first-class cricket. He became headline news in 1971, when a ball hit him on the side of the head while he was fielding in the dangerous \"short leg\" position, causing his heart and breathing to stop."}
