{"wikidata_id": "Q4344606", "title": "Gabriella Papadakis", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriella_Papadakis", "summary": "Gabriella Maria Papadakis (born 10 May 1995) is a French ice dancer. With her partner, Guillaume Cizeron, she is a 2022 Olympic champion, 2018 Olympic silver medalist, a five-time World champion (2015\u20132016, 2018\u20132019, 2022), a five-time consecutive European champion (2015\u20132019), the 2017 and 2019 Grand Prix Final champion, and a seven-time French national champion (2015\u20132020, 2022). They have won ten gold medals on the Grand Prix series. Earlier in their career, they won silver at the 2012 Junior Grand Prix Final and at the 2013 World Junior Championships.\nPapadakis and Cizeron have broken world records 34 times, which is in itself a record across all figure skating disciplines since the introduction of the ISU Judging System in 2004. They are the current and historical world record holders in the short dance, free dance, and combined total. They are the first team to have broken the 90-point barrier in the rhythm dance, 120-point and 130-point barriers in the free dance, and the first team to score above the 200-point, 210-point, and 220-point barriers in the combined total score.\nThe pair are recognized for their graceful and balletic style. Their programs, inspired by modern dance, have been described as lyrical, and commentators have frequently acclaimed the quality of their skating skills."}
