{"wikidata_id": "Q9319", "title": "Tintoretto", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintoretto", "summary": "Tintoretto ( TIN-t\u0259-RET-oh, Italian: [tinto\u02c8retto], Venetian: [ti\u014bto\u02c8\u027eeto]; born Jacopo Robusti; late September or early October 1518 \u2013 31 May 1594) was an Italian painter identified with the Venetian school. His contemporaries both admired and criticized the speed with which he painted, and the unprecedented boldness of his brushwork. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso (\"The Furious\"). His work is characterised by his muscular figures, dramatic gestures and bold use of perspective, in the Mannerist style."}
