{"wikidata_id": "Q442491", "title": "Joachim Patinir", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Patinir", "summary": "Joachim Patinir, also called Patenier (c. 1480 \u2013 5 October 1524), was a Flemish Renaissance painter of history and landscape subjects.  He was Flemish, from the area of modern Wallonia, but worked in Antwerp, then the centre of the art market in the Low Countries.  Patinir was a pioneer of landscape as an independent genre and he was the first Flemish painter to regard himself primarily as a landscape painter.  He effectively invented the world landscape, a distinct style of panoramic northern Renaissance landscapes which is Patinir's important contribution to Western art.  His work marks an important stage in the development of the representation of perspective in landscape painting.Patinir was a friend of not only D\u00fcrer, but also of the leading Antwerp painter Quentin Metsys, with whom he often collaborated. The Temptation of St Anthony (Prado) was executed in collaboration with Metsys, who added the figures to Patinir's landscape. His career was nearly contemporary with that of Albrecht Altdorfer, the other major pioneer of paintings dominated by the landscape, who worked in a very different style. He was the uncle of Herri met de Bles, who was his follower in establishing the world landscape."}
