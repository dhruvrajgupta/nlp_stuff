He founded the Gwasg y Brython press and was the author of many books and articles about life in rural Wales and Welsh folklore, as well as a series of books for children.\nEvans was a native of the small village of Llangwm, then in Denbighshire, now in Conwy. He attended elementary school before going to work as a farm labourer in his locality. He moved to Liverpool in 1875 where he founded the Gwasg y Brython Press, which became one of the major Welsh publishers of the day.\nEvans had wide interests as a writer and archaeologist. He founded the antiquarian  magazine Y Brython in 1906 and in 1911 began to publish an influential critical magazine Y Beirniad, edited by Sir John Morris-Jones. He wrote a book on folk tales about fairies in 1935. He wrote a series of stories and other books for children as well, including Hogyn y Bwthyn Bach To Gwellt.
