He was the first prime minister of Kosovo and the Foreign minister and deputy prime minister in the new cabinet led by Isa Mustafa, which assumed office on 12 December 2014.\nTha\u00e7i is from the region of Drenica in Kosovo, which is where the KLA originated. He studied philosophy in Prishtina before moving to Switzerland, where he joined the Kosovo Liberation Army in 1993. He rose through the ranks of the KLA to become leader of the most powerful faction by 1999, during the Rambouillet negotiations. He then joined the interim Kosovo administration after the war.\nTha\u00e7i became leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), which won the largest share of the vote in the 2007 Kosovo elections. In 2008, Tha\u00e7i declared the independence of Kosovo and became its first prime minister. In 2016 he was elected President of Kosovo. Tha\u00e7i has pursued a pro-American policy while in office. There have been controversies regarding Tha\u00e7i's role in the KLA and allegations about him being involved in organized crime. In 2020, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor's Office filed a ten-count Indictment, charging Hashim Tha\u00e7i and others for crimes against humanity and war crimes. Tha\u00e7i subsequently resigned from his position as president, in his words, in order to \"protect the integrity of the presidency of Kosovo\"."}
