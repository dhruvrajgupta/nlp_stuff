He attracted wider attention in 2016, when he appeared on the British reality show Big Brother and was removed after his comments on social media attracted controversy. He began offering paid courses and memberships through his website and rose to fame as an internet celebrity, promoting an \"ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle\". A self-described misogynist, Tate's controversial commentary has resulted in his suspension from several social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, where he had amassed millions of followers.On December 29, 2022, Andrew and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania along with two women; all four are suspected of human trafficking and forming an organized crime group. Romanian police allege that the group coerced victims into creating paid pornography for social media. On March 31, all four were moved to house arrest while the investigation continues. No indictment has yet been filed, and prosecutors have said that they have until late June to send the case to trial."}
