{"wikidata_id": "Q1932603", "title": "Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_D%C3%ADaz-Canel", "summary": "Miguel Mario D\u00edaz-Canel y Berm\u00fadez (Spanish: [mi.\u02c8\u0263el \u02c8di.as ka\u02c8nel]; born 20 April 1960) is a politician and engineer who is the third first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba. D\u00edaz-Canel succeeds the brothers Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro, making him the first non-Castro leader of Cuba since the revolution. D\u00edaz-Canel's leadership thus represents a non-dynastic form of succession for the party as well as for the state, and the end of Castro leadership in Cuba.\nD\u00edaz-Canel has been a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party since 2003, and served as Minister of Higher Education from 2009 to 2012. He was promoted to the post of Vice President of the Council of Ministers (Deputy Prime Minister) in 2012. A year later, in 2013, he was elected as First Vice President of the Council of State. He succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro as the President of the Council of State in 2018; in December 2019 the office would evolve into President of the Republic. On 19 April 2021 D\u00edaz-Canel assumed the reins of the Communist Party of Cuba as well, when he replaced Ra\u00fal Castro as First Secretary."}
