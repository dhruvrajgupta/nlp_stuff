He contributed substantially to European knowledge of Central Asian geography.\nHe also described several species previously unknown to European science: Przewalski's horse, Przewalski's gazelle, and the wild Bactrian camel, all of which are now endangered.\nHe was a mentor of his follower Pyotr Kozlov."}
