He is best known as the founder of modern chaos theory, a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.His discovery of deterministic chaos \"profoundly influenced a wide range of basic sciences and brought about one of the most dramatic changes in mankind's view of nature since Sir Isaac Newton,\" according to the committee that awarded him the 1991 Kyoto Prize for basic sciences in the field of earth and planetary sciences."}
