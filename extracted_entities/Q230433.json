She also studied law at the University of Tokyo and international relations at Balliol College, Oxford. She then worked for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a diplomat. Masako met her future husband Naruhito in 1986. The two were married in 1993 and welcomed their only child, Aiko, in 2001. The birth of their daughter fueled the ongoing Japanese imperial succession debate, which had resulted in some politicians holding a favorable view on rescinding agnatic primogeniture imposed by World War II allies on the constitution of Japan. However, with the birth of her brother and sister-in-law's son Hisahito in 2006, no amendments to the law were made and Masako and Naruhito's daughter remains at present legally ineligible to inherit the throne.The pressure to produce a male heir took a toll on Masako's health and she was officially diagnosed with adjustment disorder in 2004, which forced her to withdraw from public life periodically. As crown princess and empress, Masako has accompanied her husband on official visits to foreign countries and at ceremonies within the imperial court."}
