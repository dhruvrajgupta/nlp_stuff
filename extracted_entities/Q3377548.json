He won the 2014 Civic Democratic Party leadership election, promising to reform the party and regain public trust after the a corruption scandal involving Prime Minister Petr Ne\u010das. Fiala's party finished a distant second place in the 2017 legislative election, and remained in opposition despite multiple offers from the incoming Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 to participate in his governing coalition.\nIn 2020, Fiala led the initiative for a centre-right electoral alliance with KDU-\u010cSL and TOP 09, known as Spolu.
