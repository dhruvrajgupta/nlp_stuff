{"wikidata_id": "Q117337455", "title": "Evan Gershkovich", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gershkovich", "summary": "Evan Gershkovich (born October 26, 1991) is an American journalist and reporter at The Wall Street Journal covering Russia. He was detained by Russia's Federal Security Service on charges of espionage in March 2023, marking the first time an American journalist had been arrested on charges of spying in Russia since the Cold War. The White House and media advocacy groups have condemned the arrest.\nExperts have speculated that the motivation behind the order for Gershkovich's arrest was an anticipated prisoner exchange for one or more high-profile Russians imprisoned in other countries. Gershkovich, who remained in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine after his arrest in 2023."}
