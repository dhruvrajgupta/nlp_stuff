He returned to Grand Prix racing in 1966 driving a two-litre Brabham\u2013BRM for privateer David Bridges. His first race that season was the French Grand Prix at Reims where he scored his one championship point. There followed eighth places at both the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch and the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.Taylor died following a crash at the 1966 German Grand Prix, when the Brabham collided with Jacky Ickx's Matra on the first lap of the race. He emerged from the wreckage badly burned, and died from his injuries four weeks later."}
