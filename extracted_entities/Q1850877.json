After the conquest of the Malli (Malwa) and Oxydracae, these tribes also were added to his government.Philip was put in charge by Alexander of building the city of Alexandria on the Indus.\nThe territory south of the junction of the Indus with the Acesines (Chenab river) to the sea was given to Oxyartes and Peithon, son of Agenor (Arrian, Anabasis of Alexander VI.15.4)\nThe historian Johann Gustav Droysen considers this Philip to have been the father of Antigonus, the king of Asia. It is certain at least that they were both of the family of the princes from Elimiotis."}
