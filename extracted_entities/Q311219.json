He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew.\nBoth Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan were often addressed as \"Dai Goh\", meaning \"Big Brother\", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname \"Dai Goh Dai\", meaning \"Big, Big Brother\", or \"Biggest Big Brother\"."}
