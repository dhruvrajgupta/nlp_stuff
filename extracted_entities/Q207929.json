{"wikidata_id": "Q207929", "title": "Pontormo", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontormo", "summary": "Jacopo Carucci (May 24, 1494 \u2013 January 2, 1557), usually known as Jacopo da Pontormo, Jacopo Pontormo, or simply Pontormo, was an  Italian Mannerist painter and portraitist from the Florentine School. His work represents a profound stylistic shift from the calm perspectival regularity that characterized the art of the Florentine Renaissance. He is famous for his use of twining poses, coupled with ambiguous perspective; his figures often seem to float in an uncertain environment, unhampered by the forces of gravity."}
