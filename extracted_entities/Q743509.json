She is the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan.Following her birth, the ongoing Japanese imperial succession debate had resulted in some politicians holding a favorable view on rescinding agnatic primogeniture imposed by World War II allies on the constitution of Japan. However, once her uncle and the current crown prince Fumihito had his son Hisahito in September 2006 he became next in the line of succession following his father. Aiko remains at present legally ineligible to inherit the throne, while debate about the possibility of having future empresses regnant continues."}
