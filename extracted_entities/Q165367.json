He was the leading Dutch engraver of the early Baroque period, or Northern Mannerism, lauded for his sophisticated technique, technical mastership and \"exuberance\" of his compositions. According to A. Hyatt Mayor, Goltzius \"was the last professional engraver who drew with the authority of a good painter and the last who invented many pictures for others to copy\". In the middle of his life he also began to produce paintings."}
