He was previously Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2018 to 2022, and Spokesman of the Government from 2014 to 2018. \nHe received a PhD in political science from the University of Athens in 2003, and later became both a lecturer and researcher at the University of Cyprus until the early 2010s. He then served in the second-term government of President Nicos Anastasiades, a fellow Democratic Rally (DISY) member, until he resigned in January 2022 to run in the 2023 Cypriot presidential election as an independent. DISY nominated its leader Averof Neofytou as its presidential candidate. Christodoulides gained the support of smaller parties, including DIKO, EDEK and DIPA, among others and won the election after receiving 32.04% of the votes in the first round, and defeating leftist-backed Andreas Mavroyiannis with 51.92% in the run-off. He took office on 28 February 2023, becoming the island's first leader to be born in an independent Cyprus."}
