{"wikidata_id": "Q221001", "title": "Jacques Anquetil", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Anquetil", "summary": "Jacques Anquetil (pronounced [\u0292ak \u0251\u0303k.til]; 8 January 1934 \u2013 18 November 1987) was a French road racing cyclist and the first cyclist to win the  Tour de France five times, in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964.He stated before the 1961 Tour that he would gain the yellow jersey on day one and wear it all through the tour, a tall order with two previous winners in the field\u2014Charly Gaul and Federico Bahamontes\u2014but he did it. His victories in stage races such as the Tour were built on an exceptional ability to ride alone against the clock in individual time trial stages, which lent him the name \"Monsieur Chrono\".\nHe won eight Grand Tours in his career, which was a record when he retired and has only since been surpassed by Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault."}
